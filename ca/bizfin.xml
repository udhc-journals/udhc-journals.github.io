Based on internal documents, reviewed by Reuters, the report examined how Twitter has struggled to keep its most active users — and biggest driver of revenue —engaged.&nbsp;These users, who account for the vast majority of tweets on the service, are also increasingly less interested in news and entertainment and have shifted their attention to pornography and crypto. The findings underscore the myriad of challenges Musk will face to restructure the company.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

The company also notified employees in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa about the cuts. The news revealed problems with what is widely thought to be a fast-growing clean energy economy. GE and competitors have grappled with rising costs and supply chain delays, despite the energy transition.&nbsp;</p>
