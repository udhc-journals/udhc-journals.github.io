The world&#8217;s second-largest economy remains behind several parts of the world by many healthcare measures and is in the middle of a &#8216;Healthy China&#8217; programme that aims to raise average life expectancy to 79 from 76 by 2030, while increasing survival rates for cancer and other chronic illnesses. Zero-COVID may actually make those goals harder to reach. </p>

The Chinese government, alone among major countries in vowing to eradicate the coronavirus within its borders, is on track to spend more than $52 billion this year on testing, new medical facilities, monitoring equipment and other anti-COVID measures, which will benefit as many as 3,000 companies, according to analysts.</p>

In a separate notice also reviewed by Reuters, Tesla asked suppliers to estimate how many workers would be needed for full production and to provide details of workers affected by COVID restrictions.</p>

The story, with reporting from the United States, Europe and Asia, also revealed how far behind Novavax is in fulfilling its promises to governments and to COVAX, the global vaccine distribution program that plays a key role in supplying the vaccines to low-income countries. Officials in the Philippines said that they are now seeking to trim their Novavax contract, as a longer-than-expected wait for the company’s vaccine led the country to stockpile supply from other drugmakers. Several industry analysts said they are reviewing their 2022 vaccine sales forecasts of around $5 billion for Novavax in light of the news.</p>
