          Conversational learning outcomes:


          Dr Ambarish Bhattacharya presents the patient data:

          "70 yrs lady. T2DM, IHD, COPD, Obese with H/o # lower end
          of femur and hence bedridden for more than a month.
          Presented with off and on drowsiness and loss of appetite.
          Outside reports showed poor sugar control, fluctuations
          from Hypo to 400. Urine shows plenty of pus cells and
          growth of Staph. Aureus. Hb 9, TLC 16000, CRP 151,
          Creatinine 1.5, Na 125. Samples repeated after admission.
          Now culture growth Enteroccus. All others similar.
          Treated with Basal bolus insulin, Tolvaptan, Meropenem +
          Linezolid, Clexane. After 5 days CRP 45, Creatinine 0.9,
          TLC 12500, Na 134, Sugar well controlled. Planning for
          discharge.
          After 2 days patient has hematuria. CRP increased to 121,
          Creatinine 1.2, INR 2.3, aPTT > 100, Platelet 190,000, TLC
          10,000, Hb 7.7. BT, CT normal. Now urine growing Candida
          sensitive only to Caspo & Micafungin. Caspo started,
          antibiotics changed to Tiecoplanin and Moxiflox, FFP given.
          TLC now 9500, PT, aPTT normal, Hb/Platelet/Na/K all stable
          but CRP now 150. Clinically other than pallor and few
          bedsore there is nothing. Blood cs no growth, Amylase/
          Lipase/RF normal, CXR normal, USG chronic cystitis.
          Reports of D-Dimer, FDP, ANF awaited.
          What should be the next line of management?

          Active participants inputs:

Inputs from Tarun Chakrabarti 

"Discharge her with narrow spectrum oral antibiotics (according to sensitivity
report) for at least 2weeks.put a catheter.Repeat urine c/s after 2weeks.
This is a case of urosepsis with metabolic encephalopathy.At this age isolated
raised CRP has not much significance.Instead can do PCT.What is LFT report?why
ANF,RF,amylase,lipase done?"

AB reply 

Tarun Chakrabarti Only low Albumin. All others normal.
Even Procal normal.

Inputs from Pankaj Pant:

Any underlying conditions like multiple myeloma

AB reply 

Pankaj Pant Pending reports: ANF, D-Dimer, FDP, Protien electrophoresis

Input from Boudhayan DM:

What is ESR ?

AB reply 

Boudhayan Dm 80. But Hb is 7. Microcytic hypochromic

Input from Rakesh Biswas 

Interesting urine culture fluctuations. First staph then enterococci then
fungi. What was the enterococcus susceptible to? 

Sanchita Das, Biswaroop Chatterjee, Dipmala Das, would you like to comment 

AB reply 

Rakesh Biswas More problematic is the sudden rise in CRP with rise in INR and
aPTT along with fall in Hb, Tc, Dc and Albumin. And Hematuria. But Bilirubin,
ESR, Platelets remains same. No rash or arthralgia. All lines changed. Daily UB
wash with saline. New sets of Blood cs, Urine cs, stool cs sent. Reports of C.
Diff toxin, ANF, Protein eletrophoresis, FDP, D Dimer still awaited

RB reply below 

I guess as long as the WBC counts and clinical symptoms are holding well we can
breathe easy? Will be keen to see how the current abnormal markers evolve.


Input from Aadipta Ghosh 

You can do a lipid profile. CRP rises with increased LDL. Rule out underlying
malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease and do an autoimmune panel.

RB reply 

Please share links to the utility of lipid profile in correlation with CRP

RB reply after Aadipta shares links :

Thanks Aadipta. Can you quote the relevant portions that suggest that it helps
in further management. 

Aadipta reply:

Quote "In conclusion, our data show that Ox-LDL and hs-CRP levels correlate
positively in ACS patients, supporting the hypothesis that Ox-LDL and CRP may
play a direct role in promoting the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis
in these individuals. We suggest that Ox-LDL/CRP elevated levels may serve as
markers of the severity of the disease in evaluation and management of ACS
patients."

RB reply:

They suggest they could be markers but that's a long way away from being useful
in such a case scenario?


Two days later inputs from Pankaj Pant 

Any updates or diagnosis?

AB reply Pankaj Pant Pyelonephritis

Update two more days later by AB 

TLC came down from 17500 to 13400 but now again increased to 15200.
CRP down from 235 to 144, but BP dropping. Needs Norad but urine output
holding. No growth in any cultures
