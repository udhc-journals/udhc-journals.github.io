**** Individual integration of different roads to healing ****
 
The above expert patient has subsequently published another paper with our team
members where she elaborated on her cure and the integration of
multidisciplinary interventions that was brought about to effect it. She
subsequently utilized the power of online integration to provide a voice to
similar stories from many patients around the world.

conventional/52621/

Sharing the same patient voice from the article linked above, we quote below:

"the large doses of prednisone I took to try to resolve my ITP, plus the usual
factors of age, hormones, and genetics resulted in a diagnosis of
osteoporosis.   
For both of these conditions, I am sorting through the medical hype, trying to
determine the validity and meaning of the sometimes conflicting diagnostic
tests, and weighing the different approaches for improving my health.  What I’m
finding is no different from what I found 20 years ago. The treatments
suggested by the endocrinologists and alternative doctors are often very
different. The patient experiences do not match the published literature. 
There are significant pharmaceutical profit motives that may skew the
diagnosis, research, and treatment suggestions (Shomon, 2000).  Once again, I’m
balanced in the middle with one foot in the conventional world and one in the
alternative world, trying to find a secure and reliable place to heal.  And
there are millions of us who feel this way."
