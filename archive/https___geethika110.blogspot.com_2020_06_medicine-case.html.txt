 _June_19,_2020_


A 55 year old lady from Nalgonda presented to the medical OPD with complaints
of distension of abdomen and swelling of lower limbs since 3 months. Self
admittedly, a proud mother of 4, the patient was absolutely normal 15 years ago
 when one summer's afternoon turned eventful for her, having developed cough
with dyspnea and mild expectoration. The cough was occasional but present
throughout the day, associated with very little colorless sputum. At the same
time she also had dyspnoea and her husband intervened and reported wheeze also.
She denies a seasonal or diurnal variation in cough and dyspnea. She also
denied chest pain and hemoptysis at any point. The husband however says he
noticed her wheezing early in the morning but it never woke her up from her
sleep. Interjecting at this point, I ask if there was any exposure to biomass
fuel usage and the patient nodded in affirmative, with an exposure to wood
smoke for 50 years (until 5 years ago). She denies active or passive smoking.
She is unsure of a family history of similar events. These events lasted for 2
years. The couple reported that a consultation with a local general
practitioner and therapy prescribed by him resulted in complete cure of her
symptoms. This was after several consultations in vain. 

13 years ago, the patient developed distension of abdomen with diffuse pain.
She says that pedal edema preceded this abdominal distension. At the same time,
she also reported early satiety and belching. She never had weight loss or loss
of appetite. The patient says that her abdomen was 'tapped and 1.5L of fluid
drained' after which she had significant symptomatic relief. She had to revisit
the hospital after developing persistent lower abdominal pain with menorrhagia,
at which she was diagnosed with fibroid uterus and iron deficiency anemia. 2
packets of blood and a Total abdominal hysterectomy gave her significant
relief. She never had to visit a hospital again for the next 12 years. 

1 year ago, for a low back ache, she visited the local practitioner. She was
diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension and was started on medication. 

Since 3 months, the patient developed pedal edema and distention of abdomen
again. She also has early satiety. She however, has no pain this time. No
history of heartburn, dysphagia, dyspepsia, regurgitation, vomiting, visible
bowel movements, no history of chronic hiccups, no history of hematemesis,
melena or constipation or loose stools. She hasn't been dyspneic before the
distension of abdomen started. She never had palpitations or chest pain or
syncopal attacks. 

Her pedal edema is associated with brownish discoloration of both feet. She
also reports her footwear slipping while walking since the last 6 months. She
also has tingling with numbness in her feet. The patient remembers that she can
feel the temperature of water on her skin. She feels she can also feel pain.
She never reported bowel and bladder abnormalities. 

The patient is on a diabetic diet, is well supported by her husband. She is
proud of her children and says she holds her head high after having gotten them
all married. Her knee pains cause some limitations to her work but she has an
otherwise undistressed life with good functional capacity.

Patient also had painful blisters on her left facial region with similar
lesions in her left ear. They have now healed but she still has pains.
