**** Gradual integration of traditional with competency driven curricula in a
patient centered learning framework ****
The definition of competency for a medilcal student health professional is:
“habitual, consistent and judicious use of communication, knowledge, technical
skills, clinical reasoning, emotions, values, and reflections in daily practice
for the benefit of the individual being served” 
This definition was shared by MEU India faculty member Prof TS and we would
like to bring our attention to the last part of this excellent definition,
"benefit of the individual being served," which reminds us again of the fact
that the patient is the primary beneficiary of Medical education. 

The solution to the problem is to think of online formative assessments as a
process of active learning by the medical student that puts the patient at the
center of his learning portfolio. 

For example if someone is to learn Thyroid pathology and is to be assessed for
it then the learner needs to share what active patient centered efforts she has
undertaken in that process. 


Generally the process begins in understanding the life events of that real
human being with the thyroid pathology and then capturing the palpable and
investigational data acquired from that person's body with that pathology.
