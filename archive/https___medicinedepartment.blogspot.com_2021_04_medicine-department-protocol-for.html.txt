Conduct of the overall university final mbbs general medicine practical exams
from 26th April to 3rd May 2021 is as follows:

Exams will be in the virtual online open access format with optimal
transparency and accountability. Each candidate's presentation and
interrogation will be video recorded for asynchronous academic verification by
the external examiner as well as university. 

All the examinees will prepare one long case and two short cases from current
patients in the Wards, ICU, AMC during the revision practicals under the
guidance of a PG invigilator who will guide them to capture the necessary
patient data along with clinical images, radiology, EcG, drugs and instruments
being used on that patient and add it to their E log online portfolios already
available open access here: https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/03/
2016-batch-mbbs-competency-driven.html?m=1

On the day of the practical exams every examinee will start presenting the last
logged long and short cases in their E log. 

There will be two internal examiners and one external examiner onsite and one
examiner off-site on zoom from outside Telengana listening to them for 5
minutes following which they will take two minutes each to query them on the
areas delineated here http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/03/
competency-based-practical-assessment_20.html?m=1

There will be an AP faculty expert and two PG experts coordinating and
invigilating this entire process.

One PG will video record and archive each candidate's presentation and
interrogation for asynchronous academic verification by the external examiner
as well as university.
