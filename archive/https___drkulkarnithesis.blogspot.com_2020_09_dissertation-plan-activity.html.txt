DISSERTATION 
Dr. Saicharan Kulkarni pgy1 ( 2020 )
TITLE_OF_THE_TOPIC_:
 CLINICO-RADIOLOGICAL PROFILE, RISK FACTORS AND OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH MOTOR
WEAKNESS


BRIEF RESUME OF THE INTENDED WORK
Problem Representation 

1)The repercussions of paralysis/weakness are enormous, both personally to the
individual and to their family; and have huge economic costs to society.
Paralysis takes many forms with multiple disorders causing paralysis, and
multiple body systems often affected.(1,)
 
2) Motor learning is considered crucial for rehabilitation in general. In
stroke, motor learning does not refer to the acquisition of new skills, but to
the re-learning process of a previously acquired movement pattern.(2)
 
3) 3. Though both clinical evaluation and MRI are complimentary in detection
and precise localization of the level of lesion in patients with cervical
myelopathy, there is paucity of data comparing segment specific clinical
features with the MRI abnormalities in cervical myelopathy.(3)
 
 4) In neurological rehabilitation, patients can be presented with diverse
combinations of physical, cognitive, communicative and behavioural impairments,
which may impact on rehabilitation potential.(4)
 
5) A standardised assessment of neurological impairment may provide an
opportunity to control differences in case-mix and so assist interpretation of
functional gains in different populations.(5)
Outcomes of motor paralysis/weakness usually are Normal function, affecting
high level functions only, significant limitation but some useful function and
little or no useful function(5)

Between Nov 2020 and Oct 2022, 50 patients with motor weakness/paralysis
admitted at Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences, Nalgonda were studied. The
male to female ratio was 1.6:1 (n=50, Males-31: Females-19). Out of these
patients only 38% (n=19) were ≤49 years and 62% (n=31) were >49 years. The
maximum frequency of motor weakness was found for ages more than 49 years.

In our study, Most common clinical feature was hemiplegia/hemiparesis. Fifty
four percent (54%) patients had hemiplegia/hemiparesis. Among these left sided
weakness was more common (59% patients had left sided hemiplegia/hemiparesis).

In our study, most common cause of motor weakness was cerebrovascular accidents
(CVA). Sixty Eight percent (68%) patients had cerebrovascular accidents (CVA).
Among these 26% (n=13) patients had past H/O of stroke/TIA.

      Instead of

      "EXPECTED OUTCOMES: (Based on NIS scale)

      NORMAL FUNCTION

      AFFECTING HIGH LEVEL FUNCTION ONLY

      SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS, BUT SOME USEFUL FUNCTION

      UNKNOWN OR UNTESTABLE"

      Correct to

       EXPECTED Quantitative OUTCOMES: (Based on NIS scale)

      Study the time taken to achieve NORMAL FUNCTION

      Number of people with affection of HIGH LEVEL FUNCTION alone

      Number of people with SIGNIFICANT Activity LIMITATIONS, BUT retaining
      SOME USEFUL FUNCTION 

      LITTLE OR NO USEFUL FUNCTION and it's qualitative EFFECT on LIMITING

      Please cite the references in the text just after you quote them.
      Remember you can't quote more than one or two lines from any reference.

      The paragraph below appears to have been quoted from some reference?
      Please cite that reference in the text. Please google and learn how to
      cite references in text.

      "Paralysis means loss of voluntary movement as a result of interruption
      of one of the motor pathways at any point from the cerebrum to the muscle
      fiber. A lesser degree of paralysis is spoken of as paresis. The word
      plegia comes from a Greek word meaning "to strike," and the word palsy is
      from an old French word that has the same meaning as paralysis."

  A 28 year old male came with chief complaints of sudden fall followed by
weakness of both the lower limbs (paraplegia) and loss of hand grip 10 days
back, associated with bowel and bladder incontinence. History of present
illness: Patient was apparently asymptomatic 1 month back, following which he
developed productive cough, low grade fever for which he underwent sputum
studies and tested positive for AFB bacilli and started ATT - HRZE regimen, 2
tab according to weight/PO/OD. He developed generalized weakness and myalgia 15
days back. 10 days back, patient got up from bed and went to open the door and
suddenly fell down, with no loss of consciousness and no froathing. Following
which his brother got him up and since then Patient developed bowel and bladder
incontinence. No sensory impairment. Past history : He is a known case of TB
since 1month and on ATT - HRZE Not a known case of DM,HTN, ASTHMA, EPILEPSY,
