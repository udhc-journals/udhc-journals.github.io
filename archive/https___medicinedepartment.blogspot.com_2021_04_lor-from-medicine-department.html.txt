**** LOR from Medicine department ****


Dear Program Director,

    I am pleased to write a letter of reference for Ms. _________ in her
application for residency. 

I currently look after the Department of General Medicine at xyz Institute of
Medical Sciences and other than a graduate residency training and undergraduate
program, we also host a global elective learning program supported nominally by
the BMJ group detailed here: https://casereports.bmj.com/pages/bmj-case-
reports-student-electives/ and here: https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/
2021/04/medicine-department-patient-centered.html?m=1

Our department has known ______ since her second year General Medicine
rotations, and she has interacted with us most heavily in her final year
posting in General Medicine. 

During that time, she was responsible for managing patients by taking patient
history, conducting complete clinical examinations, calling in consults,
reviewing lab reports, and monitoring patient care. Ms. _____ carried out these
responsibilities with diligence and skill. 

She also attended various academic sessions and actively participated in daily
rounds. One such 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM regular ward round with students like her
is archived here: https://youtu.be/ls-h6vdW4XU and presentations in the 2:00 PM
to 4:00 PM sessions archived here: https://www.youtube.com/

She has gained experience in diagnosing and managing common medical conditions
such as, Diabetes, Hypertension, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, COPD, Stroke,
poisonings and various infectious diseases. She has performed procedures
(archived in the previously shared link above) such as pleural and ascitic tap,
central line catheterizations, endotracheal intubation and local nerve block
administration. She is also well practiced in procedures such as nasogastric
tube insertions, IV-line insertions, Foley’s catheterization and drawing
arterial and venous blood samples. She had taken the initiative to present
various topics such as, ‘Epilepsy’ and Rheumatic Fever’ and actively
participated in their discussions during academic sessions. 

Our department can strongly attest to most of our students abilities as we’ve
had the opportunity to oversee them in both the In-patient and Out-patient
setting and work with them during internship. 

    Ms. ______ has a sound knowledge of general medicine and its various
disciplines. In addition, she is hardworking and highly motivated with a good
sense of ethics and responsibility. Her communication skills and the respect
she demonstrated towards patients, staff and colleagues were impressive. I am
confident of her capability of working in a team effectively and efficiently,
as she had demonstrated good leadership on multiple occasions. Ms. _____ is a
well-rounded and promising student whom I have no hesitation in recommending
for your residency program. 

Sincerely,
