**** December 2021 weekly log and outcomes of regular patient centered learning
sessions ****
This is a regular academic session impact assessment log for the post graduate
residency training program comprising currently of residents of 2019 and 2020
batch. 

The training program comprises of a regular hands on learning of clinical
decision making during the bedside rounds from 10 AM to 1:00 PM as well as 2-
4 sessions officially divided daily into:

Theory on Monday, 

Seminar on Tuesday, 

Journal club on Wednesday, 

Tutorial on Thursday 

Group discussion on Friday 

Log Book audit on Saturday 

These are blended learning sessions with both online and offline components and
while the offline learning timings are as mentioned above, the online component
of the learning continues 24x7.

The overall impact of each learning session is assessed under two main headings
as impact on the student and impact on patient. 

The detailed headings are :


Impact : 

On learning ecosystem :

Cognitive competency levels touched in different levels of Blooms taxonomy BT
(more here : https://sites.pitt.edu/~super1/lecture/lec54091/002.htm):

Approach to disease localization (BT level 1 -3)

Resolving initial diagnostic uncertainty (BT level 1-4)

Therapeutic decision making toward evaluating patient requirements and outcome
(BT level 1-5)

Developing and testing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic solutions ( BT
level 1-6)

On patient care outcomes :

Was empathic trust built with patient and relatives?

Were the patient requirements identified adequately and a proper problem list
made toward assessment? 

Was standard of care provided with provision for care continuity ?
Prepared below from first week of December by Rashmita PGY3

December 1st Wednesday : 

journal club :
https://thejns.org/focus/view/journals/neurosurg-focus/49/4/article-pE7.xml

"Sun et al.13 performed a prospective study (level 2b evidence) on a cohort of
108 patients, in which 26 patients were treated with DX alone, 69 underwent
burr-hole craniotomy and adjuvant corticosteroids, and 13 were treated with
surgical drainage alone. In the corticosteroid group, 1 patient required
surgical drainage, whereas in the surgical group hematoma recurrence was
reported in 3 patients; no significant difference between the two groups was
measured."

Saturday log book evaluation :

Log books evaluated for 

Dr Rashmita and Dr Divya 

Observations :

No log of answers to the online assignments from June 2021 to November 2021!

The May 2021 answer was read out and many inadequacies were found the learning
points of which will be summarized by the evaluated PGs. 

The PGY3s were also asked if they would prefer to have a timed hand written
question paper for them to answer followed by their uploading their hand
written answers toward global peer review feedback (as well as allow them to
practice writing theory answer papers as is the current norm for their final
university assessments) and there has been no positive response to this option
as well till now. 

It was observed that very few PGs had shared their thesis work logs in the
manner below (although instructed to do so since the beginning of their thesis)
as illustrated here :

Dosage titration of tetrabenazine plasma concentration

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730806/

The starting dose should be 12.5 mg/day once in the morning. After one week,
the dose should be increased to 12.5 mg twice daily; it should then be titrated
up slowly by 12.5 mg at weekly intervals to identify the lowest and best
tolerated effective dose. If a dose of 37.5 to 50 mg/day is needed, it should
be given in three divided doses. Each dose should not exceed 25 mg. Patients
who seem to require doses greater than 50 mg/day should undergo genotyping for
CYP 2D6. Doses above 100 mg/day are not recommended for any patient.

Mechanism of Action of Tetrabenazine

Currently we are giving her only tetrabenazine ,which is a VMAT (vesicle mono
amine transport inhibitor) ,i.e it prevents dopamine release. For this she isnt
getting symptomatic relief . So we can add additionally D2 (dopamine receptor
blockers) ,like atypical antipsychotics( olanzepine,risperidone etc) .Can
reduce the frequency of attacks and also
 might  help with the psychiatric issues she is facing .

Questions raised
Causes of post dialysis infections Infections 
Pathophysiology of NSAID induced Renal failure

https://httpmedicin.blogspot.com/2021/12/nsaids-induced-nephropathy-with.html

There are not many studies yet showing the long-term effects of NSAIDs on the
development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it has been shown that
daily use for more than one year increases the risk of developing CKD.14

There may be progression in patients who do not discontinue NSAIDs when they
develop acute interstitial nephritis and interstitial fibrosis.5"

2-4pm class
Why does recurrent hypoglycemia in liver mets


Some patients present with hypoglycemia and liver metastases; among them, only
a few develop hypoglycemia as a result of a failure of hepatic glucose
production. Most develop hypoglycemia as a result of an insulin-mediated
process--either the secretion of insulin by an islet-cell tumor or the
secretion of insulin-like growth factor-II by an extrapancreatic tumor.


Three patients had an insulinoma and four had non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia
(NICTH) due to hepatocellular carcinoma, colon carcinoma, meningeal sarcoma,
and hemangiopericytoma, respectively. All of the patients had liver metastases

Glucagon stimulation test (serial glucose measurements after a 1 mg infusion of
glucagon) as part of the workup for hypoglycemia were retrospectively reviewed.
Those patients whose test revealed a rise in serum glucose of >30 mg/ dL were
subsequently treated as outpatients, with a continuous glucagon infusion
delivered by a portable pump.

Why does recurrent hypoglycemia occurs in patient with Liver mets
1. All patients with insulinoma responded to glucagon with a rise in blood
serum glucose levels, indicating adequate glycogen stores.
2. The four patients with NICTH had mixed responses: in two patients, the
response suggested that hypoglycemia was due to an insulin-like tumor product; 
3.glucose levels did not rise in the other two cases, indicating that
hypoglycemia was due to poor hepatic glycogen reserve/liver failure. 
In all cases, a glycemic response to glucagon predicted good response to long
term treatment with glucagon (0.06-0.3 mg/hour, via intravenous infusion pump).
