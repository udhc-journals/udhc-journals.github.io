**** Blended bimonthly assessment Oct-Nov 2020 results ****
 Following are the links to the submitted assignments by the students (interns,
PGs year 1 and year 2) for the the assignment posted for 7/10/2020 here: https:
//medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/09/medicine-paper-for-october-2020-
first.html?m=1  and the assignment posted for 16/11/2020 here:https://
medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/11/blended-learning-bimonthly-
assignment.html?m=1 

     and in the links below one can find that the summative has been also
     accompanied by a numerical formative assessment of their online
     learning portfolios using both verbal and non verbal cues. 

     Interns from 2015 MBBS batch posted in the department of Medicine

     The formative assessment has been divided into non-verbal which
     assesses their competency in procedural domains including empathic
     communication and body language and verbal which assesses their
     ability to communicate their work through their day to day E logs.


     Most students have done reasonably in the formative assessment in
     both verbal and non verbal communication domains although a lot
     remains to be improved on. 


     Most students haven't done well at all in the summative assessment as
     they are still trying to get a hang of how to express themselves in
     an online open access world where their answers are meant to create a
     societal impact rather than impress just one examiner who may end up
     giving good numerical scores in appreciation of their ability to
     answer from rote memorized facts as per tradition. It's possible that
     in the current phase of evolution we may find that many have not only
     plagiarised blatantly from articles on the internet (inspite of
     express instructions on how not to resort to that) but also copy
     pasted from each other's log books.
