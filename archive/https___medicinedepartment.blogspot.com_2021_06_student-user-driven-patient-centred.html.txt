**** Student user driven, patient centred assessment prototype ****
 
This module is a continuation of the 

Working prototype of a scholarly integration of medical education and research
framework shared here :

medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/06/working-prototype-of-scholarly.html?m=1

The patient's problem described in the module above was part of a question
paper of the month for the entire batch of 2017 and is accessible here in Q5B
with 10 other questions:

assignment.html?m=1
Student SM's answer is available online around the patient question in Q5B here
:https://drsaranyaroshni.blogspot.com/2021/05/assignment-patient-centred-
learning.html?m=1 where they are derived from standard theory of clnical
problem solving but very interestingly she makes a mention of the child's
problem again in Q10 which is about sharing her learning experiences of the
month where she presents artwork collected from the patient and also goes on to
describe many more patients where she was a part of the data capture process
for our CBBLE. Although the question paper for the month of May 2021 which she
answered above wasn't meant to test empathy competencies (unlike that of April
2021 available here: http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/04/medicine-
paper-for-april-2021-bimonthly.html?m=1) yet she also managed to display her
empathy competencies in her answer to Q10.
