**** Workflow for the MD university final case based viva summative assessment
****
MCI guidelines for Clinical / Practical and Oral Viva examination quoted below
verbatim from their website PDF document linked below:

"(i) Clinical examination for the subjects in Clinical Sciences shall be 
conducted to test the knowledge and competence of the candidates 
for undertaking independent work as a specialist/Teacher, for which 
candidates shall examine a minimum one long case and two short 
cases.

(iii) The Oral examination shall be thorough and shall aim at assessing 
the candidate knowledge and competence about the subject, 
investigative procedures, therapeutic technique and other aspects of 
the speciality, which form a part of the examination.
A candidate shall secure not less than 50% marks in each head of 
passing which shall include

(1) Theory, 

(2) Practical 
including clinical 
and viva voce examination."

The above has been shared by us before last year here : http://

medicine.html?m=0

Now coming to the most important part of the actual workflow for the exam
please take a look at the university supplied format here with marks
distribution : http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/06/lets-first-look-
at-pre-covid-status-of.html?m=1 which was meant for a pre pandemic offline
audience and even now in this pandemic with a predominant blended online and
offline format of the examination, we shall still abide by letter and spirit of
the exams as the university intended it earlier. In the above link if you
notice in the first columns to the left there are 100 marks allotted for one
long and 100 marks allotted for two short cases and 100 marks allotted for the
viva with some brief  instructions subject to examiner interpretation. 

To achieve a collective consensus on the interpretation of the traditional
university supplied format, we propose that :

1) The candidate begin with the long and short case presentations as currently
accessible to them locally in the hospital or even from OPD or telephonic
interview (follow up) and they make sure they share their case history (patient
events in sequence) and clinical findings images as well as investigations as
in the samples below :

Current case :

dyspnoea.html

In traditional case presentations, the case discussion is generally expected to
be prepared after a reviewing the literature around similar cases globally :

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21702278/

As well as locally :

If we again review the viva competency assessment 100 marks distribution in the
link here: http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/06/lets-first-look-at-
pre-covid-status-of.html?m=1 we realize that most of them will be covered in
the case presentation and the discussion will mostly be centred around the
candidate's competency to resolve the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties
in the case using evidence based literature review as well as prior general
knowledge. 

A paragraph here about pedagogy is important as the traditional university
document mentions it in the marks distribution : Pedagogy is a natural learning
process that can be demonstrated through the candidate's discussion of the case
that originates in the pedagogic questions raised. I quote from the article
linked below. Pedagogic understanding derived from case based learning,
"imparts relevance to medical and related curricula, is shown to tie theory to
practice, and induce deeper learning." https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/
articles/PMC5736264/

More quoted from:  https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/
s12909-020-1969-0 around the case based pedagogic approach, "Case-based
learning (CBL) is an inquiry-based pedagogical approach that prepares students
for clinical practice through authentic cases to develop their clinical
decision-making skills.
CBL can foster students’ learning in terms of knowledge acquisition and
application, intrinsic motivation [8], patient assessment [11], problem-solving
[12], and critical thinking [13, 14]. Moreover, pictorial information in the
case materials induces intuition, and objective and quantitative information
induces analysis [15]."

The other items in the viva such as thesis and logbook can be represented by
the candidate again in an evidence based manner by sharing the links to her
thesis such as here :


https://vamsikrishna1996.blogspot.com/2020/10/thesis.html?m=1

https://chandanavishwanatham19.blogspot.com/2021/03/of-thesis-clinical-
profileevaluationdia.html?m=1

And log book such as here :

https://karnativaishnavi.blogspot.com/?m=1


https://drkulkarnimd.blogspot.com/?m=1


https://drvaishnavi.blogspot.com/?m=1


https://ashiness3.blogspot.com/?m=1

We shall need each candidate to prepare their separate deidentified roll
numbered case presentation log, 

three year worklog (E log book mentioning their personal summary of their
competencies attained) and thesis log for the examiners to go through. 

Each of these three separate logs will be deidentified and candidates
identified only with their roll numbers. 

Informed consent has to be taken from each case being presented, which can be
downloaded from here : 
http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/05/informed-patient-consent-
and.html?m=1

Here is a detailed link :

https://2018-21batchpgy3gmpracticals.blogspot.com/2021/08/pg-final-year-2k18-
21-batchuniversity.html?m=1


to the last similar blended online examination conducted this year in the same
manner for the PGs passing out this year and below is another link 

https://mbbs2k16batchgmpracticals.blogspot.com/2021/05/2k16-batch-gm-
university-practical.html?m=1

to the last similar blended online examination conducted for UGs this year in
the same manner although for lesser marks  as it was for UGs but even they had
to present one long and two short cases. The difference was that they were
interviewed for shorter time as opposed to the PG interview where the mandatory
time allotted for each of them is one hour. The difference in long and short
cases again lies in the fact that they are time bound into long and short time
frames where the entire sequence of patient events (history) is thoroughly
discussed in the long case and a quicker decision around the diagnosis is
achieved through certain findings alone. 

Hope this explains our current evidence based stance on the conduct of the
assessments and further inputs in the form of queries are welcome in the
comments section below.
