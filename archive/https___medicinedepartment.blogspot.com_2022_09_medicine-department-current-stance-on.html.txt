**** Medicine department current stance on LORs ****
Introduction :

LORs are frequently necessary for residency applications globally and it's
important for the LOR seeker and LOR giver to do justice to this process. 

The problem statement below in  

Conversational learning transcripts :

[6/3, 9:09 AM] LOR Seeker: Hi sir 
Good morning


[6/3, 9:10 AM] LOR Seeker: 

Hope you are doing good 
Myself ... 
I am from 2Kxy batch.
I did my internship under you.

I was with xyz mam, abc sir..PGs 


[6/3, 9:12 AM] LOR Seeker: I gave my step exams and currently working as a
research fellow currently at ...US 


I need your support for the residency application. 

I am so sry I am very informal texting you.

I am currently in US,so couldn't meet you in person to request you an LOR.


[6/3, 9:13 AM] LOR Seeker: Could you please send me your email address so that
I can send my eras portal request to upload an LOR.


Thank you.

Hope you consider my request. 

Sincerely, 


[6/3, 9:14 AM] Medicine Department: 

Can you share some links to your work to let me assess you for the LOR?


[6/3, 9:17 AM] LOR Seeker: Sir,I will send few cases which I worked on and
presented.

The mortality and morbidity meets which I attended.

Amma Nana ashram visits.

But in that year,we didn't create an online portal for our patients which was
started 2 years later...

[6/3, 9:19 AM] Medicine Department : Currently we are providing LORs only to
our students who are working with us in our current projects here 👇

departmental.html?m=0


[6/3, 9:27 AM] LOR Seeker: Ok sir 
Thank you ...
I will try uploading my cases if I can.


[6/3, 9:31 AM] Medicine Department : 

No we may have a better project role for you. 

Can you share the deficiencies in the current case reports posted by the
current batches listed here 👇
https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2022/02/?m=0

We can add you to our current 2017 case discussion group for the same


[6/3, 9:33 AM] LOR Seeker: Yes sir
Sure will do


[6/3, 9:42 AM] LOR Seeker: It was so good and helpful.
I could have asked you and joined the group long back..

I have my deadline to upload my LOR in 10 days.

Still,I will do my best and be in touch base with my juniors and provide my
input.


[6/3, 9:43 AM] Medicine Department : Better get that LOR from the college
Principal office as per protocol


[9/3, 9:45 AM] LOR Seeker: Most of the program's are asking from the chair of
Internal Medicine sir.

I have submitted my MSPE from principal sir.

I worked under you during my internship.So,thought I would take from you


[6/3, 9:47 AM] Medicine Department : 

Should have thought about it earlier. We don't do 10 days.  10 months is the
least we can do although most of our LOR students are 5 years


[6/3, 9:49 AM] LOR Seeker: Yes sir .I even regret that.

I didn't knew that,my friends last year have taken like that.
So I am not sure of the process.

I am really sorry for that.

Thank you for adding me to the group.


[6/3, 9:51 AM] Medicine Department : 

Many of your friends didn't get our LOR as they couldn't live up to these
requirements we set for them

Previous stance on LORs from Medicine department :

recommendation.html?m=1


Probable solution 

In conversational learning transcripts :

[6/5, 8:11 AM] LOR Seeker: Sir 
U will definitely remember me.

We saw bud-charie syndrome(icu 1st bed)young female 

PSVT
Acute necrotising fascitis

In mortality meet we presented Pulmonary embolism and hypokalemia cases 

Old male with back pain-later turned out to be spinal Mets (we referred him to
cancer centre)

Dengue 

Sydenham chorea 

Malaria

HIV-i have been to lab to check stool for cyclospora,isospora,.(ART was given)

Stroke cases.
Hyponatremia.

I even worked for ashram cases.


[6/5, 8:15 AM] Medicine department : Alright write up all your experiences with
our unit in your blog and that will be good evidence for us to provide the LOR.

[6/5, 8:32 AM] Medicine department
: In your write talk more in detail about the patients you saw and the problems
they had and the way our unit tackled their problems

[6/5, 8:35 AM] LOR Seeker: Ok sir 
Sure will do that 👍
Thank you so much.

[6/12, 7:03 AM] LOR Seeker: Sir ,this was my experience with the patients.
I wrote it .

[6/12, 7:05 AM] LOR Seeker: Should I post it like a blog how my juniors are
doing the case presentations?

[6/12, 7:07 AM] Medicine department
: Yes. That would be considered an open access publication submitted for post
publication peer review 👍

[6/12, 7:56 AM] Medicine department
: Also we would need yours and everyone of the past and current batch students
permission for this "LOR driven reflective learning" project and will be
subjecting your current reflective-narrative publication to a global post
publication peer review (as in with the other 1000 students in our dashboard)
in which case would you like to remove the identifiers in your write up and
also realistically point out the shortcomings in your internship instead of
just painting a pretty picture as you have done currently as that would
immediately be labeled skewed if not totally unrealistic


[6/12, 8:06 AM] Medicine department
: Let me share another interns write up to give you a better idea


[6/12, 8:09 AM] Medicine department
: Yours is a generalized incident narrative while this one here https://
chandanavishwanatham19.blogspot.com/2022/05/a-day-in-life-of-medicine-
pg.html?m=1 is a particular incident narrative by one of our current interns/
residents (I guess you know that in US their interns are PGY1s)

[6/12, 10:11 AM] LOR Seeker: http://yyyy1234567.blogspot.com/2022/09/
transitioning-from-text-book-approach_11.html

[6/12, 10:13 AM] LOR Seeker: I have changed the URL also sir

[6/12, 9:04 PM] Rakesh Biswas: Thanks. I shall get this peer reviewed and let's
see if we can have a suitable LOR for you, going by your self testimony in this
blogged write up.
