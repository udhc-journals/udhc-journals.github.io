**** Thesis draft "Clinical complexity in Diabetes: Qualitative evaluation of
patients, interventions and outcomes." ****
Problem statement/Background:

Among patients with diabetes, clinical complexity and treatment burden have
increased over time." (1)

"Piette and Kerr created a framework dividing multiple chronic conditions into
three categories: (a) concordant (illnesses which share similar pathogenesis
and management as diabetes such as cardiovascular disease), (b) discordant
(where the illness is unrelated, yet whose management may be at odds with
diabetes care, such as musculoskeletal disease or mental illness), and (c)
dominant illnesses, whose severity overshadows diabetes care (such as end-stage
renal failure or metastatic cancer)."(2) 


"The ADA/AGS consensus breaks diabetes treatment goals into three strata based
on the following patient characteristics: for patients with few co-existing
chronic illnesses and good physical and cognitive functional status, they
suggest a target A1c of under 7.5%, given their longer remaining life
expectancy. Patients with multiple chronic conditions, two or more functional
deficits in activities of daily living (ADLs), and/or mild cognitive impairment
may be targeted to 8% or lower given their treatment burden, increased
vulnerability to adverse effects from hypoglycemia, and intermediate life
expectancy. Finally, a complex patient with poor health, greater than two
deficits in ADLs, and dementia or other dominant illness, would be allowed a
target A1c of 8.5% or lower." (3)



AIM: 

To navigate clinical complexity in patients with diabetes and optimize their
management toward reducing diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty along with
improvement in their anemia outcomes. 

OBJECTIVES:
• To assess various clinical and investigational characteristics of patients
with diabetes in relation to their clinical complexity and outcomes.
• To analyse patient outcomes based on morbidity (physical, social &
psychological limitations)

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
PLACE OF STUDY: Department of General medicine 

STUDY PERIOD: November 2022- October 2024

STUDY DESIGN : Non experimental (Observational) qualitative Study 

SAMPLE SIZE: 50 patients 

Methodology.and objectives :

To be detailed after going through the sample cases linked below (and more). 

INCLUSION CRITERIA:

• Complex Diabetes patients of any gender above or equal to 18yrs of age at the
time of presentation.

Complex needs of the Diabetic patients would be assessed using the COmplex
NEeds Case-finding Tool – 6 (CONECT-6), which evaluates the following
variables: low perceived health; limitations due to pain; unmet needs; high
self-perceived complexity; low income; and poor social support. With a
threshold of two or more positive answers, the sensitivity was 90% and
specificity 66%. The positive and negative predictive values were 49 and 95%
respectively. (4)




EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

1.Patients below 18 yrs of age (minors)

2.Patients not capable of giving consent (mentally-ill patients)

3.Patients not willing to participate in study (non-consenting patients) kp

4. Non complex diabetes 


PROFORMA (data to be captured) 


Demographics

Patient event data reflected in a narrative history of the  sequence of events
leading to the current presentation and outcomes

Body data from clinical general and systemic examination 

Pallor 

Lymphadenpathy 

Nails 

Organomegaly

Muscle mass 

Mid arm circumference 

Visceral fat 

Body data from laboratory investigation :

    * CBP with peripheral smear 
    * Iron profile with serum ferritin 
    * Serum albumin 
    * Serum creatinine
    * Special tests on indication :
    * Thyroid function tests 
    * Chest X-ray -PA view
    * ECG
    * 2D ECHO
    * Bone marrow if indicated 
Data from treatment instituted :

Data from Patient reported outcomes :

Daily functionality (in terms of routine activities)

Daily diet in the form of meal images captured before consumption 

Daily intake output where relevant such as complex anemias with renal failure
and nutritional deficiency or anemia and chronic diarrhoea

uncontrolled diabetes with alcoholism) 

Clinical complexity consists of a few defining characteristics such as
uncertainty, non linearity, unpredictability and yet an overall pattern leading
to resolution through attractor states over time. (5) As physician attractors
we are uniquely privileged to "be" with our patients regardless of the
diagnosis and that is the only way we may know our patient's outcomes where our
"being" with them is the most significant (and often overlooked) intervention.
