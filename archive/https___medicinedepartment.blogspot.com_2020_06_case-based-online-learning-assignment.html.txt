**** Case based online learning assignment for MBBS 2016 UGs, 2nd week of June
2020: 3 patients with pedal edema and one without ****

          Last week we had six case presentations recorded on video
          although the links are yet to be uploaded by our interns
          but we have some patient data for analysis that some of our
          interns have shared it in their E logs below for the online
          8th semester students to go through this week and answer
          some of the case related questions and also come out with
          their own queries:

          Offline discussion session video: yet to be uploaded.
          Please get in touch with the  intern Dr Kumar. 

          A few common questions for the 8th semester students

          1) Where are the different anatomical locations for the
          cause of the edema for each of the three patients and
          weakness for the fourth Patient?

          2) What is the most likely pathology and etiology in that
          anatomical location?

          3) What are the diagnostic and therapeutic options in such
          situations and what is the efficacy of each option/
          intervention?

          4) Please share questions that come to your mind upon going
          through each of the cases.

          Each 8th semester student will share their answers in their
          own E logs. Thanks to all the 8th semester students for
          previously sharing all their 200 web based logs that will
          remain as their 'online learning portfolios,' and will be
          very useful toward their formative assessment in the coming
          months and years. More here:

     Sample active learning discussion of the same 2016 UGs last week

          Once the 8th semesters join hospital duties they will be
          expected to evaluate their own patients in the wards and
          learn data capturing to create their own patient online
          records for analysis.
