****** BMJ_Elective_Case_Log ******
This is an online E logbook to discuss our patient's de-identified health data
shared after taking his/her/guardian's signed informed consent. Here we share
our individual patient's problems for learning inputs from the available global
online communities of experts with an aim to solve that patient's clinical
problems with collective current best evidence-based inputs. This E logbook
also reflects my patient-centered online learning portfolio.
