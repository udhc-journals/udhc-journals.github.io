Uzma_Kamal She is having rheumatoid arthritis since 10 years. Pain started from
her left hand associated with swelling and stiffness of joints. After
consulting with doctor pain and swelling subsided for some times. 
Then after a month she started feeling pain on benfing knee and then pain
gradually radiate towards ankle and hip joints. 
Then on investigation it was diagnosed to be rheumatoid arthritis. Since then
she was on medication. 
Now she complainted, a month ago she felt swelling on the left side of her oral
gum along with pain which aggrevates on chewing or talking. 3 days before
admitting here she was having fever and bleeding from her oral mucosa.

Rakesh_Biswas Boudhayan please share her X ray hands with Dr Nidhitomorrow. I
am sure it will show some very significant erosions like our recent last
patient with similar hands along with a scleroderma overlap.

Boudhayan_Dm Has the X Ray hands been done? I have seen the Chest X Ray but not
X Ray Hands . I guess the focus was different this time. Nidhi_Sehgal Maam I
was going through few articles on role of USG in articular diseases..... Few of
my seniors in Immunology used to practice it..... How far are we applying that
here ? My topic of interest( departure from this patient though) is USG of
Thyroid apart from mastering other USGs( Inspired by You Sir Rakesh_Biswas)

Praveen_Ky Patient has inflammatory arthritis and on methotrexate.IMage is
showing deformities of hands.possibilities are 1. Rheumatoid arthritis with
pancytopenia probably related to methotrexate or related to feltys syndrome
related to RA.Foot ulcer could be vasculitis related.
2. CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS -SLE with pancytopenia/ mixed connective tissue
disease 

3.Other differentials are sarcoidosis /behcets/other vasulitic disorders like
PAN/ mPan/ churg Strauss

Evaluation would require 

Esr/ crp
ANA profile /RA FACTOR/ anti Ccp 
Uss abd for splenomegaly 
ACE and c Anca/ P Anca if above tests are negative
Bone marrow examination if required

Rakesh_Biswas Thanks for the detailed inputs Dr Praveen. This will definitely
benefit our students. As the history taken today by our student Uzma suggests a
long term course of illness for 10 years and with the classic deformities and
bilaterally symmetrical hand erosions we can safely limit the diagnosis to
Rheumatoid arthritis in this classic case (Prof Michele for her inputs here).
She had stopped Methotrexate since the last 6 weeks and was recently on
Salfasalazine and as our suspicion of her pancytopenia hovers around drug
induced, currently we are thinking it could be sulfasalazine as a possible
culprit for her severe anemia. Boudhayan it would be nice if you could find
something around salfasalazine induced pancytpenia. Uzma can you share the
image of her oral cavity with the bleeding soft tissue tumor?

Rakesh_Biswas Uzma, Ravi can you share the images of her CXR pa and also let us
have some more details of her cought. Her CXR pa view is suggestive of another
chronic problem that usually occurs in this disease and recently we had even
published one such case in the BMJ after extensive discussions here in tabula
rasa Boudhayan

Boudhayan_Dm Rakesh_Biswas SIR should we add or not antibiotics...... As
infective exacerbation is more common in our country than eosinophilic one ....
In these context let me introduce my teacher Dr Angira_Dasgupta who is a
pioneer in Airway diseases in the world . Maam request you for your kind
opinion. Pt has already received abt 5 days of augmentin but her cough has
worsened.... More productive now with white mucoid sputum. We have budecort
nebulization. Will she require Macrolides or Steroids...... Wish we had the
sputum analyzer which you have set up at my Alma mater

Rakesh_Biswas Boudhayan the nasopharynx is predominantly colonized with non-
hemolytic and alpha-hemolytic Streptococci and Neisseria species with
occasional carriage of Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus
influenzae.Determining the prevalence of bacteria in the lower respiratory
tract has proved problematic due to the difficulty of obtaining lower
respiratory tract samples uncontaminated by upper airway secretions.https://
