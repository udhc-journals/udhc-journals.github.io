Information Literacy" *****

Citation para:

An innovafive OPR method known as "collective conversational peer review"
(designed to integrate medical education and practice) exemplifies the use of
an evolving creation process as a critical appraisal tool for submitted
manuscripts, which simultaneously offers medical students publication credit
and interactive training (Podder et al., 2018, p. 112). This type of dynamic
peer review is an excellent example of a new information product giving
participants a way to "articulate the traditional and emerging processes of
information creation and dissemination in a particular discipline" (ACRL, 2016,
p. 14). By collaborating with faculty across disciplines, academic librarians
can incorporate these Innovative approaches to peer review as a creative method
to implement the frame "Information Creation as a Process."
