**** Inviting potential prize winners and delegates for "clinical problem
solving 2022" ****
This is a call for early bird, free registration of delegates to the Jan 25,
"Clinical problem solving 2022" conference with a chance to win clinical
problem solving prizes, where delegates will be chosen based on their early
bird online responses to the 10 semistructured clinical problems shared in our
conference webpage here : http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/12/
medicine-conference-on-theme-clinical.html?m=1

The problems are shared in the webpage schedule through linked semi structured
case reports that will also be physically discussed during the conference by
our current featured speakers. 

Meanwhile we are looking forward to potential delegates and prize winners going
through these problems and submitting their "clinical problem solving" entries
in the following steps :

a) Prepare a problem list 

b) Identify the patient problem solution requirements in terms of priority 

c) Suggest current standard evidence based solutions (mentioning the RCT
evidence available in a PICO format) 

as well as 

d) suggest innovative solutions (mentioning how they may design an ethical
trial to scale their proposed innovative solution)

Entries need to be made in the potential delagate's blog and depending on it's
merit there can be a discussion with the organizing team (either in the
comments page of the delegate's blog or on whatsapp text or email), and the
entries generating the best discussion and learning insights will receive the
"2022 clinical problem solving prizes" that will be announced at the end of the
conference. 

Here is a link : https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2022/01/sample-
clinical-problem-solving-logs.html?m=1 to 
 a few sample logs of our clinical problem solving 2020-21 students. 

Other than clinical problem solvers, we also welcome as delegates, classical
singers or musicians (who are medical students or just clinical problem solving
enthusiasts from any discipline), as we are looking forward to having a short
classical music piece sung or played by a talented delegate before each
session. They may want to share their own YouTube channel archives for us to
send them a delegate confirmation.   

Free delegate registration confirmation will be sent by whatsapp text or email
depending on the potential delegate's above mentioned inputs not later than
January 20th.   

Free delegate registration essentially includes offline participant delagate
pass at the conference venue, CME credit hours and breakfast, lunch, tea. The
conference is single day from 8AM to 5:00 PM at Narketpally. 

Our institution also hosts a Clinical problem solving elective with
opportunities to publish their clinical problem solving case reports in BMJ
Case reports detailed here :  https://casereports.bmj.com/pages/bmj-case-
reports-student-electives/


We also have a 24x7 clinical problem solving discussion group on whatsapp that
interested participants may want to join by clicking on this invitation link
