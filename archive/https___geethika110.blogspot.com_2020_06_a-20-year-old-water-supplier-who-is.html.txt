A 55 year old lady from Nalgonda presented to the medical OPD with complaints
of distension of abdomen and swelling of lower limbs since 3 months. Self
admittedly, a proud mother of 4, the patient was absolutely normal 15 years ago
 when one summer's afternoon turned eventful for her, having developed cough
with dyspnea and mild expectoration. The cough was occasional but present
throughout the day, associated with very little colorless sputum. At the same
time she also had dyspnoea and her husband intervened and reported wheeze also.
She denies a seasonal or diurnal variation in cough and dyspnea. She also
denied chest pain and hemoptysis at any point. The husband however says he
noticed her wheezing early in the morning but it never woke her up from her
sleep. Interjecting at this point, I ask if there was any exposure to biomass
fuel usage and the patient nodded in affirmative, with an exposure to wood
smoke for 50 years (until 5 years ago). She denies active or passive smoking.
