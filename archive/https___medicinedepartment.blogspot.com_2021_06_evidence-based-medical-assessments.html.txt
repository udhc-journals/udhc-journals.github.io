**** Evidence based medical assessments drive student learning outcomes ****
Here is a link https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/03/2016-batch-mbbs-
competency-driven.html?m=1to competency driven, evidence based formative and
last summative assessment of the 2016 MBBS batch who are currently posed to
graduate soon after their university final last month in April 2021. 

Capturing medical students procedural (non verbal) and verbal cognitive
competency 

The evidence for each student's competency is reflected in the captured videos
(open access herehttps://youtube.com/
playlist?list=PLvYjjuT_hEEQDtlHSAvFdRpCb5EBszwgR) of their procedural
performance (where the assessment is subjective non verbal) and in the patient
centered active learning verbalized by them in their patient E logs, both
reflecting their online learning portfolios.

Some of the commendable student E logs (online learning portfolios) are shared
in the links below:

We do also have a paper based log book that showcases sample case reports by
past students and provides instructions on utilizing it as a competency
enhancement and learning tool as detailed here : https://

Below is a link to an archived list of the E logged textual presentations and
videos of the same 2016 batch students physical presentation and viva during
their recently concluded university exams in April 2021.

This is not just evidence based medical education with evidence of correlation
between awarded marks (quantitative learning outcomes) vs process of assessment
(qualitative data capture inputs to drive assessment) but also an attempt to
integrate Medical education with practice by putting the patient at the center
of Medical education.
The above annual MBBS  summative assessment evidenced by the 150-200 students
assessments videos in the above link is based on our university summative
assessment protocol here :

for.html?m=0
 which highlights the concordance between our "patient centered integration"
goals and prior university competency assessment goals. 

Coming to post graduate summative  assessments of the students linked below is
a detailed framework developed from pre-existing university assessment
frameworks and maintaining previous competency assessment goals along with our
scholarly integration of medical education goals:

We regularly connect with our students live during our 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM
morning rounds as videoed and archived in the link below where we are
presenting our cases to a global audience:

Here's a summary video of what we do

Currently we are working on developing evidence based letter of recommendations
for our students detailed here : http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/
