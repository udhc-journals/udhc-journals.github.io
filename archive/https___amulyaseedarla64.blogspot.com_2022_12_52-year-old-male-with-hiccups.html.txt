**** 35_yr_female_with_shortness_of_breath ****

 _February_27,_2022_

A 35 year old female from marapaka, came to casualty with c/o shortness of
breath since 20 days.  History of present illness :- Pt was apparently
asymptomatic, 2 months back then she developed breathlessness which is
insiduous in onset since 20 days which aggrevated on performing physical work
and was relieved on rest. Then she  visited a local hospital in miryalaguda, on
evaluation she had low hemoglobin count and 2 blood transfusions were done and
was given medicines for a week. After using these medicines for one week she
developed bilateral pedal edema (pitting type). So she visited a hospital in
guntur. As there are no aarogyasri services in guntur she came back to nalgonda
regarding the same issue. She had one more blood transfusion in Nalgonda
hospital. Later she developed breathlessness and visited our hospital. She was
on medication and her breathlessness subsided after 3 days of admission. She
had 5 blood transfusions here and was on dialysis(10). Pedal edema did not
subside
