**** Case based online learning assignment for MBBS 2016 UGs, 3rd week of June
2020: 2 patients with pleural effusion 2 patients with ascites ****
               Last week we had six case presentations recorded
               on video although the links are yet to be
               uploaded by our interns but we have 4 patients
               with serosal effusion data for analysis as to the
               cause and further possible solutions. 
               This data has been collected and shared by some
               of our interns in their E logs linked below for
               the online 8th semester students to go through
               this week and answer some of the case related
               questions and also come out with their own
               queries:

               1) Presented by Dr Sambodhi 2015 batch:
               A 54 year old male patient came with Pain in the

               Offline discussion session video: yet to be

               A few common questions for the 8th semester
               students

               1) Where are the different anatomical locations
               for the cause of the problem described in each of
               the four patients?

               2) What is the most likely pathology and etiology
               in that anatomical location?

               3) What are the diagnostic and therapeutic
               options in such situations and what is the
               efficacy of each option/intervention?

               4) Please share questions that come to your mind
               upon going through each of the cases.

               Each 8th semester student will share their
               answers in their own E logs. Thanks to all the
               8th semester students for previously sharing all
               their 200 web based logs that will remain as
               their 'online learning portfolios,' and will be
               very useful toward their formative assessment in
               the coming months and years. More here:

               Once the 8th semesters join hospital duties they
               will be expected to evaluate their own patients
               in the wards and learn data capturing to create
               their own patient online records for analysis.
