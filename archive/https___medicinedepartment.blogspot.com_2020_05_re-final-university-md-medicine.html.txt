**** re: Final university MD Medicine summative assessment conduct as per
available guidelines from different national and state bodies ****
What/Current status 

The final university MD Medicine summative assessments are the usual exit point
and opportunity for residents to ascend to a higher hierarchy in the healthcare
ecosystem with many becoming practicing consultants and many going ahead for
further fellowships in organ based specialties. 

Why/Problem Statement 

In an ideal learning ecosystem driven by daily formative assessments, the
students would never need a summative assessment that is often performed over
few hours in a select day at the end of three years to test an individual's
competencies gained over the last three years, which really sounds very
imperfect when one thinks about it but then this is the real world where in
most medical colleges globally, formative assessments are far from perfect and
students are either too overworked to reflect and log their daily workflow with
learning reflections, conceptualizations and experimentations in their
prescribed web log books and maintain a steadily growing online learning
portfolio or their teachers are too overworked to review those. For more around
the methodology of web log books driving regular acquisition of formative
learning competencies that goes into an individual's online learning portfolio

How/Proposed exam design 
(as per current Council guidelines) 


Current local university guidelines 

I found this from the NTRUHS website which was our recent previous university:
http://ntruhs.ap.nic.in/examinationss/index.html

"Note

1. For conduct of exams in PG Degree/Diploma courses rules are followed as per
Medical Council of India, New Delhi and the recommendations of Board of
Studies/E.C Resolutions of Dr. NTR UHS, Vijayawada/Hon’ble Court Orders from
time to time."

And nothing yet mentioned in knruhs website which is our current university
http://knruhs.telangana.gov.in/syllabus

So we deemed it best to follow the MCI examination guidlines, which is a
central governing councils for medical college education in India. 


MCI guidelines for Clinical / Practical and Oral Viva examination quoted below
verbatim from their website PDF document linked below:

"(i) Clinical examination for the subjects in Clinical Sciences shall be 
conducted to test the knowledge and competence of the candidates 
for undertaking independent work as a specialist/Teacher, for which 
candidates shall examine a minimum one long case and two short 
cases.


(ii) Practical examination for the subjects in Basic Medical Sciences 
shall be conducted to test the knowledge and competence of the 
candidates for making valid and relevant observations based on the 
experimental/Laboratory studies and his ability to perform such 
studies as are relevant to his subject.

(iii) The Oral examination shall be thorough and shall aim at assessing 
the candidate knowledge and competence about the subject, 
investigative procedures, therapeutic technique and other aspects of 
the speciality, which form a part of the examination.
A candidate shall secure not less than 50% marks in each head of 
passing which shall include

(1) Theory, 

(2) Practical 
including clinical 
and viva voce examination."

MCI examination guidelines PDF linked below:

ajpAhV1zTgGHb8iDwUQFjABegQIBRAH&usg=AOvVaw0mx0p_znvnAI1cGeGY5wmU

Finally we come to how exactly we wish to conduct the examination here locally
so that 

1) There is minimal intrusion in the local patient centered workflow thus not
harming patients 

2) There is maximal utilization of this additional learning in the regular
workflow thus actually benefiting patients. 

We shall address points 1 and 2 above as we discuss the actual conduct of the
exam in an hourly timeline below:

A)  Clinical examination competency testing of the students. 

1 Long case and two short cases 

(100 + 50x2=200 marks)

General Medicine requires skills and competency to capture clinical data from a
given patient in the form of the patient's past and present life events in the
form of a history timeline followed by further data collection from the body in
the form of general survey points as well as different organ system review in
the form of local examination in the patient's body and this is followed by
gathering all the data into a pattern that suggests the reason for the
patient's symptoms and signs in terms of a physically localizable pathology as
well as etiology, which is further followed by formulating a therapeutic plan
based on the diagnostic model created from the patient data acquired by the
student. 

The competency to do this well in both OPD (outpatient department) and IPD
(inpatient department) encounters with a patient is what will be tested by a
team of internal and external examiners for each candidate. 

To do this we shall provide each candidate with two short cases from the OPD of
50 points each and one long case from IPD each of 100 points (they are named
short or long cases as the time needed is different to achieve closure in
either type of case) and the examiners will have the choice of examining the
candidates right there in the OPD or IPD or take all of them to a central
location in a separate spacious demo room where the candidate can be allowed to
also share the clinical data captured over a PPT projection for the convenience
of focusing on the candidate's presentations with minimum hassles. 

While the above may test the candidate's cognitive competencies, to test their
procedural competencies, one can in some patients get the candidates to perform
certain procedures that will be anyway necessary in those patients that day or
evaluate their prior recorded videos clearly showing their skills in one
procedure either diagnostic such as ascitic or pleural taps as well as lumbar
puncture or even drawing of ABGs and therapeutic such as intubation or central
line insertions. 

Other than this a video of the entire examination interview of the candidates
discussing their cases during their clinical competency evaluation as well
videos of their ability to discuss a topic during the viva examination will be
recorded for audit purposes to improve upon the current conduct of the
examination. 

For a link to recent internal formative assessment videos depicting a similar
clinical case and viva evaluation please click here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhXqgGpfIEo&feature=youtu.be

Viva details: (100 marks) 

As visualized in the above videos other than the case presentation and
discussion for 300 marks the viva is carried out by asking the candidate to
speak on a chosen topic with a competency assessment goal as directed by the
MCI and I quote again from the MCI link, "...The oral or viva aims at
assessing the candidate's knowledge and competence about the
subject, investigative procedures, therapeutic technique and other aspects of
the speciality."

The viva assessments points can be further broken down by testing the
candidate's skills in 

1) Broad overview of the topic 30 marks 

2) Searching the evidence base around efficacy of diagnostic and therapeutic
interventions 15 marks 

3) Critically appraising the literature especially single RCTs done to
establish diagnostic and therapeutic efficacies. 15 marks 

4) Sharing their original work done  during the course of their theses
dissertation which will be cross examined by the four member examining Team to
obtain an understanding of the candidate's competency in research methodology.
20 marks 

5) Log Book maintained as an online learning portfolio along with their regular
reflection on cognitive and procedural competencies gained with some of their
procedural videos. 

Some sample E log books along with procedural competency videos can be accessed
here in the link below:

Frequently asked questions FAQs 

1) How will the cases be allotted?

In the morning, the PGY2 student expert conducting the exams will allot one IPD
patient and 2 OPD patients each to the ten candidates such that when 5
candidates are examining their 2 OPD cases the the other 5 shall finish their
IPD patients, and the IPD patients will largely be exclusively in the AMC, ICU
or even wards while the external examiners after inspecting the students taking
the cases into their laptops to their satisfaction will lounge in the clinical
lecture hall waiting for the presentations to happen which will also be video
recorded in toto by one of our PGY1s or interns.

2a) Sir one doubt.. to prepare a ppt it takes time to collect info and type it
in a PowerPoint.. so we will be given cases one day before ??

2b) Should the ppt made during the examination sir or should we be ready with
the power point beforehand sir?

You don't need to type the text into PPT slides. Just collect images of your
clinical findings and imagings that's all. The rest you can present by reading
your case notes.

The candidates may or may not collect the clinical data as text but they will
definitely collect clinical images or videos as well as EcG, echo, X-ray, USG,
CT, mri images and project those during the presentation.

For viva no PPT again except sharing of journal RCT data from a PDF that can be
scrolled up and down. 

3) Ok sir so we need our laptops to make a ppt?

Yes but not to make a PPT but to share the clinical, ecg and image data on the
clinical lecture hall projector.
