**** National Medical Integration and the role of scholarly integration in
Medical education and research ****
 
India is uniquely posed toward a "national medical integration of it's existing
non mainstream medicine (grouped under an acronym ayush) streams with that of
mainstream medicine. This is also a nationalist resurgence of Indian Medicine,
Ayurveda that was slowly and systematically weakened during India's dominion by
the British. This resurgence is partly inspired by our neighbor China who have
successfully integrated many areas of Traditional Chinese medicine with Western
medicine and successfully under Prof Tu spearheaded the application of
Traditional Chinese Medicine at the time of a malaria epidemic in the 1960s
which eventually led to a Nobel Prize. The Chinese Medical Association
wholeheartedly supported this as a matter of national pride. (Ref:Su X-Z and
Miller LH. The discovery of artemisinin and the Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine. Sci China Life Sci 2015; 58: 1175–1179.)

As a part of this resurgence in India every national laboratory, especially
those belonging to medical institutes and other government-funded institutions,
will be encouraged to research AYUSH systems, collectively funded by national
agencies to ensure that the discoveries from traditional Indian Medicine
receive acknowledgement, much like the Nobel prize-winning work of Chinese Prof
Tu Youyou. (Reference: journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09727531211009800)

British bridge course and spurt of national medical integration in intermittent
100 year cycles:

Just to address the question of when mainstream Indian medicine (the ideal
integrative medicine of that time), became disintegrated we may need to review
the fascinating 200 year old history of an apparent bridge course floated by
the British for getting native Indian students for its newly opened college to
begin training the natives who were practicing Ayurveda. Ayurveda was much more
popular in India than Western Medicine at that time and the British worried
themselves silly that there would be no takers among the natives for the mbbs
course that they were planning to begin for the first time in India. At that
time a popular course for learning Ayurveda was the Baidyak discipline in
Sanskrit College, Kolkata. In 1835, the British set up the (Modern? British?)
Medical College near Sanskrit College, Kolkata.
The Baidyak discipline was discontinued at the Sanskrit College and one of its
Ayurvedic teachers joined Medical College as an assistant teacher. He studied
Western medicine along with the students and passed in 1840. In 1845, he became
the Superintendent of the Hindusthani medium. In 1848, he was promoted to a
first class sub-assistant surgeon. In 1852, the Bengali medium was opened at
the Medical College for the first time. Gupta took charge as the Superintendent
of the Bengali medium. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhusudan_Gupta
First attempt at national medical integration in India 100 years back :
Further reading on nationalist movements in medical education may take us to
1921 when national medical college was born from an earlier experience of its
allopath founder who previously served as a principal of Baidyasastra Pathi."
While Kabiraj Bachaspati was the principal of the Ayurvedic section,
Sundarimahan was the principal of the allopathic section of the institution.
Sundari Mohan advocated independent research in Ayurveda on scientific lines.
His greatest contribution along this line was the establishment of the "Jatiya
Ayurbigyan Vidyalaya" in 1921, (also known as Calcutta National Medical
College) founded as a product of the Non-cooperation movement. It was
inaugurated by Subhas Chandra Bose. Calcutta National Medical College was
nationalized in 1967. Perhaps the first private medical college in India to be
nationalized. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundari_Mohan_Das

Exactly 100 years later this year Indian national  health policy makers are all
set to create a fresh framework for national medical integration. Scholarly
integration of Medical education can offer that framework. 

In the next section we proceed to describe that framework.
