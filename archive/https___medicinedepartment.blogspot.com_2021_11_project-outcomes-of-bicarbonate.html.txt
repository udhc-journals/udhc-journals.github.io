**** Project : Outcomes of bicarbonate correction in severe high anion
metabolic acidosis due to renal failure along with one case report form and
CDSS ****
Project introduction :

"Replacement of sodium bicarbonate to patients with sodium bicarbonate loss due
to diarrhea or renal proximal tubular acidosis is useful, but there is no
definite evidence that sodium bicarbonate administration to patients with acute
metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, septic
shock, intraoperative metabolic acidosis, or cardiac arrest, is beneficial
regarding clinical outcomes or mortality rate. Patients with advanced chronic
kidney disease usually show metabolic acidosis due to increased unmeasured
anions and hyperchloremia. It has been suggested that metabolic acidosis might
have a negative impact on progression of kidney dysfunction and that sodium
bicarbonate administration might attenuate this effect, but further evaluation
is required to validate such a renoprotective strategy."

Conversational learning around the same patient :

[11/21, 7:42 PM] Moderator :Â 

Log Book assessment: PG Med Â 


Context : An elderly patient with severe anemia, hypotension, severe metabolic
acidosis, encephalopathy and recent fracture femurÂ

Impact :Â 


On learning ecosystem :


Cognitive competency levels touched :


Approach to clinical localization of disease pathology was done reasonably well
and differential diagnostic hypothesis formulatedÂ 


On patient care outcomes :


Empathic trust built with patient and relativesÂ 


Standard of care provided with provision for care continuity Â 


Challenges met/not met : managing diagnostic Â arranging of repeating hemoglobin
levels, repeat imaging to assess hematoma, continuing dialysis, reviewing the
literature around giving bicarbonate in high anion gap metabolic acidosisÂ 


[11/21, 7:43 PM] Moderator : ðŸ‘†How is this patient now? ðŸ¤”


[11/21, 7:44 PM] PG Med: Sir he expired at 10 am today ,

Quoting from above link :

Dialysate (HCO3â€“) prescriptions differ widely throughout the world. About half
of HD patients in the United States are dialyzed in â‰¥37 mEq/L dialysate (HCO3â€“)
[34], while 83% of HD patients in Japan are dialyzed with dialysate (HCO3â€“) of
<30 mEq/L [35]. Metabolic alkalosis due to the high dialysate (HCO3â€“) has been
associated with the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia, intradialytic
hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypercapnia, hypoxia, intradialytic hypotension, and
vascular calcification [36, 37]. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) or other causes of ventilator impairment, higher dialysate
(HCO3â€“) can cause CO2 accumulation and potentiate hypoxia. The DOPPS report
also demonstrated a dramatic increase in mortality due to severe infection in
patients receiving higher (HCO3â€“) dialysate [34]. Increasing dialysate (HCO3â€“;
in the range of 28 and 40 mEq/L) induces intra-dialytic and post-dialysis
alkalosis but has no effect on pre-dialysis acidosis [38, 39]. To prevent pre-
dialysis acidosis, oral NaHCO3 may thus be considered.

[11/21, 7:45 PM] PG Med: The bicarb correction had also caused respiratory
acidosis sir


[11/21, 7:46 PM] PG Med: His sensorium also deteriorated and when we wanted to
intubate, he went into cardiac arrest

[11/21, 7:49 PM] Moderator : So what was the dialysate prescription that had
been given to our patient on Day 1?Â 

Interestingly his hypotension too was intradialytic and he had come with a
normal BP on admission?

[11/21, 7:52 PM] PG Med: Yes sir presentation bp was 150/90mmhg, first
intradialytic bp drop required single ionotropes for 6 hours post dialysis


[11/21, 7:52 PM] Moderator : Share his first dialysate prescription

[11/21, 7:58 PM] PG Med: Yesterday he had an episode of bradycardia in the
afternoon when his pco2 wasn't raised sir,revived with atropine , so I think
bradycardia is a seperate episode sir

[11/21, 8:00 PM] PG Med: Sir casesheet is dispatched
Intradialysis first day for 2hour dialysis 200 meq was given in the can sir,the
rate of delivery is variable per hour, so around 75 to 50 meq was givenÂ 
Second day 300meq in 4 hours , which was again 50 to 75 new/hour sir


[11/21, 8:03 PM] Moderator : How do our dialysate bicarbonate concentrations
compare with the ones shared in the above linked paper


[11/21, 8:04 PM] Moderator : Did our high dialysate concentration induce
metabolic alkalosis?Â 

Also do our dialysis doctors vary the dialysate concentration in a case by case
basis?


[11/21, 8:08 PM] PG Med: Vary case by case sir

[11/21, 8:08 PM] PG Med: We undercorrect it sir, only half of the requirement
is given to prevent metabolic alkalosis


[11/21, 8:09 PM] PG Med: But for him as acidosis was refractory, contemplating
whether we overcorrected it

[11/21, 8:11 PM] Moderator : So how do we decide how much to give?


[11/21, 8:12 PM] Moderator : His terminal acidosis was respiratory?


[11/21, 8:12 PM] PG Med: We calculate the deficit sir
And give half of it in the can and not directly if the patient can wait till
dialysis,
Rate of delivery per hour ,I did not check sir
If he's having symptoms of overload we simultaneously remove more ultrafiltrate
sir


[11/21, 8:12 PM] PG Med: Yes sir breaths became shallow


[11/21, 8:13 PM] Moderator : Could his respiratory depression have been due to
metabolic acidosis which precipitated respiratory acidosis terminally?


[11/21, 8:15 PM] PG Med: Been trying to find that mechanism sir, the extra co2
did it come from the bicarb or did hypoventilation cause it


[11/21, 8:16 PM] Moderator : Hmm generally when we see extra Pco2 we always
think respiratory while if we would have thought extra bicarb that would be
reflected as metabolic alkalosis? ðŸ¤”


[11/21, 8:18 PM] PG Med: Yes sir but if his respiratory centre is compromised
will alkalosis happen


[11/21, 8:18 PM] Moderator : Did he have alkalosis or acidosis?


[11/21, 8:19 PM] PG Med: Respiratory acidosis sir

[11/21, 8:19 PM] Moderator : So why think about alkalosis?
