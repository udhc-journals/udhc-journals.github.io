For more about the university and NMC (regulators body) guidelines for
conducting the final MBBS practical viva exams click here :Â https://
medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/03/final-university-mbbs-medicine.html?m=0

Quoting from the above link :

"Emphasis should be on candidateâ€™s capability to elicit history, demonstrate
physical signs, write a case record, analyze the case and develop a management
plan.

Viva/oral examination should assess approach to patient management,
emergencies, attitudinal, ethical and professional values. Candidateâ€™s skill in
interpretation of common investigative data, X-rays, identification of
specimens, ECG, etc. is to be also assessed."


MCI examination guidelines PDF linked below:

Finally we come to how exactly we wish to conduct the examination here locally
so thatÂ 

1) There is minimal intrusion in the local patient centered workflow thus not
harming patientsÂ 

2) There is maximal utilization of this additional learning in the regular
workflow thus actually benefiting patients."

medical students from five and more batches Â with their logged and regularly
evaluated patient narratives toward their formative assessment that goes to
formulate their internal assessments marks and is also an evolving question
bank for the university final and NEET exams.Â 

CBBLE stands for case based blended learning ecosystem first described here :
