**** Three patients of Hemiparesis: Case based online learning assignment for
MBBS 2016 UGs, 1st week of June 2020 ****
     Around last week we had three patients of hemiparesis admitted with
     us and our interns have shared it in their E logs below for the
     online 8th semester students to go through this week and answer some
     of the case related questions and also come out with their own
     queries:

     1) Presented by Dr Jaswitha 2015 batch:
     A 45 Year old woman with headache since 2 years and right sided
     swaying of the body since one month:

log.html?m=1


     Offline discussion session video: yet to be uploaded. Please get in
     touch with Dr Aditya. 

     A few common questions for the 8th semester students

     1) Where are the different anatomical locations for the cause of the
     hemiparesis  for each of these patients?

     2) What is the most likely pathology and etiology in that anatomical
     location?

     3) What are the diagnostic and therapeutic options in such situations
     and what is the efficacy of each option/intervention?

     4) Please share questions that come to your mind upon going through
     each of the cases.

     Each 8th semester student will share their answers in their own E
     logs. Thanks to all the 8th semester students for previously sharing
     all their 200 web based logs that will remain as their 'online
     learning portfolios,' and will be very useful toward their formative
     assessment in the coming months and years. More here:

Sample active learning discussion of the same 2016 UGs last week around three
patients of paraparesis here:

     based-questions-and.html?m=1

     Once the 8th semesters join hospital duties they will be expected to
     evaluate their own patients in the wards and create their own patient
     online records.
