https://raveen07.blogspot.com/?m=1

Logbook update : last in June 16, 2021 as an answer to the May 2021 online
assignment for the monthly summative test. 

Learning Competency assessment from the summative test : 

the answers to the questions in the online question paper assesses the
examinee's competencies in empathically dealing with:

Clinical problem solving 

Medical terminologies familiarity including areas of anatomy, physiology,
pathology 

Current EBM strategies for managing diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty.
More here : https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/05/online-blended-
bimonthly-assignment.html?m=0


Other competencies undocumented by the PG. No assessible link to current
workflow showing procedural or case presentation videos as well as verbal
report of daily case based workflow. 

Impact : Negligible and below expectations in terms of logged workflow. 
However, the PG has unlogged competencies demonstrated during work in the form
of working longer hours with discipline but tends to avoid academics. 

Student 2: Dr Zain PGY2

https://zainalammohammed59.blogspot.com/?m=1

Logbook update : last in September 8 2020
as an answer to the Sept 2020 online assignment for the monthly summative

pathology 

Current EBM strategies for managing diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty

Other competencies undocumented by the PG. No assessible link to current
workflow showing procedural or case presentation videos as well as verbal
report of daily case based workflow. 

Impact : Negligible and below expectations in terms of logged workflow.

of patient empathy, resource generation and utilization to meet patient
requirements and this has had palpable impact on our learning ecosystem. 

Log Book audit summary:

Logged learning points : nil

Logged learning impact: nil Reasons : Disinterest, apathy, lack of scholarship
of integration?

Catheter-directed thrombolysis of deep vein thrombosis: literature review and
practice considerations

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778526/

Long-term outcome after additional catheter-directed thrombolysis versus
standard treatment for acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (the CaVenT
study): a randomised controlled trial:

Conventional anticoagulant treatment for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
effectively prevents thrombus extension and recurrence, but does not dissolve
the clot, and many patients develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). We aimed to
examine whether additional treatment with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)
using alteplase reduced development of PTS.

P - 209 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (108 control, 101
CDT). Patients aged 18–75 years with a first-time iliofemoral DVT were included
within 21 days from symptom onset.

I - CDT vs Conventional anticoagulantion.

O- At 24 months, 37 (41·1%, 95% CI 31·5–51·4) patients allocated additional CDT
presented with PTS compared with 55 (55·6%, 95% CI 45·7–65·0) in the control
group (p=0·047). The difference in PTS corresponds to an absolute risk
reduction of 14·4% (95% CI 0·2–27·9), and the number needed to treat was 7 (95%
CI 4–502). Iliofemoral patency after 6 months was reported in 58 patients
(65·9%, 95% CI 55·5–75·0) on CDT versus 45 (47·4%, 37·6–57·3) on control
(p=0·012). 20 bleeding complications related to CDT included three major and
five clinically relevant bleeds.
