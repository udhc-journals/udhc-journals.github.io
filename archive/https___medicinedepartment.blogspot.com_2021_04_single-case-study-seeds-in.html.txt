ABSTRACT (IMRAD format):
Introduction:
Single case studies are research studies of single participants. They explore
new ideas and can suggest extensions in methods and for treatment (Yin, 1984).
Methodology:
We utilized a single case study seed design in a series of patients with
neurodegenerative disorder attending the medicine and Psychiatry services of
our rural medical college catering to a district population of 2,000,000
Results: A thematic analysis of each single case data was done and themes
tabulated.
Discussion:
In our patients of neurodegenerative brain disorder we find common ground in
their presentation as a movement disorder along with psychiatric symptoms and
later going on to develop different course of events during their illness. We
postulate that movement disorder is an obvious logical bio-clinical marker
toward organic psychopathology of psychiatric symptoms found in
neurodegenerative disorders and detailed study of the accessible events in
these patients can offer newer insights to the organic nature of psychiatry.

INTRODUCTION:

In recent times, the distinction between organic and functional psychoses has
become blurred and these are better described as primary and secondary
psychoses, where “secondary” refers to there being an identifiable pathogenic
substrate.1
The pathophysiology of psychosis and the role of motor circuits in the
development of psychosis in neurodegenerative disorders is complex but few
hypothesis suggest that lesions of the right lateral prefrontal cortex or its
efferent projections, such as the basal ganglia and limbic system, are
associated with delusions while frontostriatal circuitry disruption after loss
of neurons, as in caudate atrophy may alter relevant processing of
striatal‐limbic information and favor the development of psychosis.
In addition to structural alterations, faulty dopamine signaling, including
altered dopamine receptor modulation, has been proposed as a possible pathway
for the genesis of delusions and in summary brain mechanisms underlying
delusional symptoms may be similar in both primary and secondary psychosis
which needs further research. 
(https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.12882)
To further explore the above hypothesis that a better understanding of organic
psychopathology of psychiatric symptoms particularly in neurodegenerative
disorders can be gained from a detailed study of the accessible events, we
utilized a single case study seed design in a series of patients with
neurodegenerative disorder attending the medicine and Psychiatry services of
our rural medical college catering to a district population of 2,000,000 and
below is a detailed qualitative description of what we found followed by a
tabulation of the emerging themes.
CASE SERIES:

CASE 1:
A 50 year old man, a married farmer presented to our hospital with the
complaints of frequent falls, involuntary movements of his distal upper limbs
and self talking since 1 year.
On further interviewing his wife, she gave a history of him falling from his
bike 2 years back after the patient had a sudden blurring of vision. He however
sustained no head injury during the accident but attained fracture of his left
tibial bone for which open reduction & internal fixation was performed.  She
revealed that he was a regular alcoholic with a daily consumption of 90 ml of
whiskey and chews around 5 tobaccos everyday. Since the past 1.5 years his wife
tells us that he has been having frequent falls, he would frequently walk into
objects. She described him to ‘walk straight’ without turning his head. 
She described her husband to be an aggressive individual and would often get
into quarrels in matters which weren’t of his concern. However, since the past
1 year he had been socially distancing himself, has reduced expressing himself
emotionally. He would often complain of hearing strange voices. 
Since the past 7 months, he had to visit local hospitals a couple of times for
weakness in his lower limbs and had to receive potassium correction because of
recurrent hypokalemia. He has been on Potassium Chloride oral supplementation
ever since. 
2 months back, he was evaluated for his symptoms and a CT brain along with an
EEG was done which showed a normal study.     He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s
disease and was started on Syndopa 110mg and Trihexyphenydryl 2mg twice a day.
On presentation to us, he was conscious, coherent and oriented to time, place
and person. His MMSE was 30/30. He had mask like facies, he had no expressions
on his face while interacting. He had a stooped posture and on observing his
gait, he had a festinating gait and would walk straight without turning his
head. He also had reduced arm swing.
His muscle tone was increased in all the four limbs and his biceps, triceps and
knee reflexes were exaggerated, his plantar reflex showed flexion. On cranial
nerve examination, he was not able to perform upward or down ocular movements. 
On further evaluating the case, his metabolic parameters were within the normal
range.

He was put on Tab Syndopa 110mg thrice a day, Tab Quetiapine 25 mg once a day.








CASE 2:

Mr. X, a 66 years, right handed, uneducated, married farmer, hailing from rural
background of Sate of Telangana with pre-morbidly well adjusted without any
significant past or family history of mental illness presented to our
psychiatric inpatient services on 9th July, 2018 with his wife for gross
rigidity in body, asymmetric tremors since 4 to 5 years and visual
hallucinations, memory deterioration, disinhibited behavior, fearfulness, early
& middle insomnias and episodes of aimless wandering since last 2 years. His
voice became muffled and lower in intensity and would answer only in one or two
words than to his previous self. His family members noted that pace of his gait
and normal arm swings were remarkedly reduced by the end of December 2015. He
was shown to neurophysician in nearby district hospital 3 years before and was
started on twice a day combination of Levodopa/Carbidopa (110mg). However,
there was only little response and his shaky, pill-rolling movements of distal
hands were gradually increased in frequency, intensity and duration with a
typical static pattern getting incapacitated to hold any objects over a period
of last 6 months. For his disinhibited behavior he was given 5 mg of
haloperidol for a week by private psychiatrist after which his rigidity and
bradykinesia worsened and he further developed confusion when he was put on 6
mg/day of trihexyphenidine as he stopped identifying people visiting his home
and episodes of disinhibited behavior, talking to self, visual hallucinations,
fearfulness, delusion of persecution, aimless wandering increased. He began
reporting that he could see some strange people standing in front and observing
him, running in his verandah, at other times he would behave as if his
relatives were sitting beside his bed and he screamed few times as if snakes
were crawling around his bed/house.  His self-care, social interactions with
his friends and his usual activities like going to vegetable market and
attending social functions were almost stopped. There was no history of
headache, seizures head injury or vomiting in morning (r/o intra cranial SOL),
neither there was history hyperorality and hypersexuality, repeated, over
ritualistic activities (r/o specific syndromes) or thought alienation or other
SFRS (r/o schizophrenia). 
On examinations, he did not have any fever, signs of meningeal irritations,
spine or cranium deformity. He was conscious, oriented to time and place but
was confused about persons around him. His mood was depressed and labile.
Perceptual distortions were present. His cognitions were impaired (MMSE done on
09/12/2018 -11/30), his memory registration and retrieval were poor and there
were gross deficits in recent, remote and working memory. His speech was
muffled, low volume, curtailed and monotonous without any inflections or
prosody. His judgement, praxis, simple calculations, object naming, logical
thinking and insight was impaired. His posture was stooped and gait was
festinating. He had symmetrical tremulousness of his distal upper limbs with
typical 6 Hz frequency, coarse, pill rolling tremors, predominant contraction
and relaxation of flexor and extensor with less prominent rotatory component
between finger and thumb. His tone in muscles and joints were increased as he
showed cog-wheel type of rigidity on clinical evaluation. His cranial nerves
were normal. His vitals and other systemic examinations were essentially
normal. He was hospitalized and comprehensive assessments were done. His
neuroimaging showed gross generalized frontal atrophy.  
     

An Axial T2 Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging in index patient showing
asymmetric cerebral atrophy extending to the central sulcus with mild,
generalized enlargement of fronto-temporo-parietal sulci and mild decrease
signal intensity of basal ganglia with apparently normal width of pars compacta
in substantia nigra without any clear depigmentation or any blurring or
thinning in contrast to what is typically seen in Parkinson’s Disease (Figure 1
A).


There is also an evidence of mild thinning of post-central gyrus on left >
right side but not of pre-cental gyrus or central gyrus indicating initial
stage of cortico-basal degeneration (Figure 1 B). 

Midbrain tegmentum area appear smaller in size than normal, however, pons and
cerebellar volumes are apparently normal and there are no T2 hypointensities in
either of putamen or caudate nucleus ruling out Multiple System Atrophy (Figure
1 C).

At our hospital, he was diagnosed as Parkinson’s Plus Syndrome (Idiopathic
Parkinson’s disease with Dementia and Cortico-basal degeneration ) and admitted
in inpatient psychiatric services. He was started on Quetiapine 50 mg HS, his
Syndopa (110 mg/day) dose was increased to thrice a day, 10 mg morning
memantine was started for his dementia which gradually increased to 20 mg/day.
60 mg Propranolol was added for his tremors. 2 mg of Lorazepam was given in
initial first few days for his sleep disturbances along with quetiapine. His
serial MMSE was done weekly which started improving a 3 to 4 points score over
12 to 16 weeks of time (MMSE Score on 9 th April 2019 was15). His ADS Cog Score
improved from baseline 26 to 36). His hallucinations, delusions, disinhibitory
&amp; wandering behavior showed markedly improved so as his sleep and personal
care. He was trained for helping finish his routine and basic needs and use of
directions specific symbols and behavioral principles were taught to family.
His bradykinesia, tremors mildly reduced but his rigidity continued, and in
last 6 months or so, he again started deteriorating markedly in cognitive
functions (MMSE score in October 2019 was 10), developed apathy and worsened in
his parkinsonian symptoms specially rigidity and akinesia and was not
responsive to even QID Levodopa  (110 mg). Eventually in January 2020, he
developed difficulty in identifying relatives, upper limb myoclonic jerks and
dystonia in neck and upper limbs leading to dysphagia. We increased the dose of
Mimentine to 30 mg/day and added Tab Rivastigmine 3 mg/day, Tab Clonazepam 6 mg
/ day and stopped lorazepam while continued others, however, there was no
specific improvements and patient became bed ridden and his quality of life
deteriorated rapidly.



Case 3:
A 67 year old married woman presented to our hospital along with her husband
and daughter complaining of Involuntary movements of right forearm since 4
months, Involuntarily movements of left index finger and thumb since 4 months.
Since 4 months , her husband started noticing involuntary movements of her
right forearm which would be more at rest and would also be present during her
sleep. Over the next few days, she developed involuntary movements of her left
Index finger and thumb following which she even developed on and off
involuntary movements of her tongue. 
Since the last 20 days, he says she hasn't been involving herself in
conversations and stopped responding to people or would sometimes respond
late. 
On examination, she was conscious, oriented to time, place and person though
not willing to communicate or respond to the asked questions. She had mask like
facies. She also had asymmetrical rhythmic small amplitude movements of distal
muscles of  her right forearm and pill rolling tremors observed involving left
thumb and index finger, occuring even at sleep. Her tremors were present at
rest and absent on motor activity. She had slow initiation of motor activity
and delayed verbal response. Her limbs had lead pipe rigidity present and all
her reflexes were exaggerated. On cardiovascular system examination, she had a
systolic murmur heard in aortic area till apex.
Her laboratory investigations were within the normal range. Her 2dEcho revealed
severe aortic stenosis, concentric LVH with an ejection fraction of 55%.
 
Her MRI Brain showed mild cerebral atrophy, tiny calcifications with no edema
in right lentiform nucleus and left temporal lobe, small vessel ischaemic
changes.

She was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and was discharged on Tab Syndopa
110mg thrice a day.
She was discharged on Tab Syndropa 110mg thrice a day along with Tab Neurobion
Forte.
She reviewed to our hospital after one month happy with the results and told us
that her tremors have comparatively reduced.
She reviewed back after 2 months of using Tab Syndropa 110mg thrice a day,
complaining of increased tremors in her distal upper limbs. Her dose was
escalated to Tab. Syndopa Plus 125 mg QID.











CASE 4:
A 49 year old English and Telugu language lecturer presented with a 2 month
history of progressive asymmetric involuntary movements of his right index and
middle fingers.
 
The patient reports that he first noticed them happening nearly 6 months ago,
which was very small in amplitude, affecting these two fingers only. He attests
that these movements often worsened with rest and abated with activity. They
were not troublesome initially but since the past 2 months he has been unable
to correct answer sheets because of the involvement of his thumb and
maintaining stability of his hand was proving difficult. He describes these
movements as involuntary, rhythmic to and fro oscillations.
 
He also adds that his handwriting has become ugly with very small letters. On
interviewing further, the patient reports that he feels stiffness in his wrists
(Right>Left), which has now ascended to his elbows. He says the stiffness is
present throughout the range of motion. He also says that since the last 1
month, the same involuntary movements also started appearing in his left hand. 
 
At this point, he also says that his walking has become difficult with small,
short steps and a forward stoop, and he feels that although he weighs 60 kgs,
he feels like it weighs 100 kgs. 
 
He does not report any difficulty in reading the newspaper, holding the paper,
turning pages or folding it back. He does not have any difficulty in brushing
his teeth or combing his hair. He also denies having difficulty in holding
objects, such as holding a water bottle to drink nor any difficulty in mixing
food and eating it. He does not have any difficulty in wearing a vest or in
buttoning or unbuttoning of his shirt. No difficulty in lifting his lower limbs
and wearing a trouser.
 
The interview continues and we question for any difficulty in taking the stairs
- he reports that he has been having difficulty in taking stairs up, in that he
feels he sometimes might lose balance. He has no difficulty in descending
stairs. The patient also denies having swaying of his trunk while walking or
overshooting his hand while picking up objects. 
 
On pressing further - he reports that he hasn't been having morning erections
since 2 months and also reports a loss of sexual desire. He also says that
since 2 months his bowel habits have been incredibly erratic, in that he
sometimes has an immediate urge to defecate when he has tea and sometimes goes
2 to 3 days with constipation. 
 
He, however, denies feeling dizzy or lightheaded when waking up in the morning.
He denies having stiffness in his lower limbs, denies cotton wool sensation of
floor, denies burning pain or inability to feel hot or cold stimuli. He also
denies buckling of knees but, however, he reports that he has been having a
great difficulty to walk in the dark since 2 months and says that he feels like
he would definitely fall without support. 
 
His brother gives a positive affirmation for all his symptoms and also says
that he previously used to be a fairly jovial and hardworking man with good
oratory skills, however, since the last 2 months he says his brother's speech
lacks that 'edge' which he previously had. On asking further, the brother says
that he has been speaking in a monotonous drab since 2 months. 
 
The patient denies ever having urinary incontinence, memory deficits, the
brother vehemently denies the patient ever being anti-social, he does not have
any difficulty in forming new memories or any visual deficits. 
 
He has no relevant past or family medical history. 

On presentation, the vitals of the patient were stable. His MMSE score was 29/
30. Cogwheel rigidity was noted at his right wrist, Tongue tremors &
microphagia were present. On foot tapping examination, movements of his right
lower limb were found to be slower than his left lower limb. He had a postural
blood pressure drop, on supine posture his bp was 180/110mmhg and on checking
his blood pressure after 3 minutes in standing posture it was 160/90mmhg. 
The patient was started on Tab Syndopa 110mg 4 times a day.


CASE 5:

A 58 year old man, married, saree maker by occupation presented to our hospital
with the complaints of 
Slurring of speech since 6 months, deviation of mouth to the right along with
smacking of lips since 6 months, urinary incontinence since 6 months and
forgetfulness since 3 months. Patient puts designs on sarees but since the past
1 year he couldn't put it properly so according to his wife, his threading
wouldn't look good and at times, they would get complaints from customers
regarding that, because of this he was asked to quit working. 
Patient previously would get up daily, take a shower and daily visit a temple
nearby but since the past 8 months the patient would get God's idols from the
temple and they were found in his pockets and also in his room. When asked, he
denied getting them home. They stopped allowing him from going to temples.
Since the past 6 months patient would just sit at home and he slowly developed
slurring of speech.
Since that past 5 months, his wife says the patient has been forgetting names
of tools with which they would put design on sarees. He is able to recollect it
after around 10 minutes or if prompted, though he was able to recall people's
names. He stopped going for shower by himself unless prompted to. He has not
been shaving his beard by himself as he used to previously do, his son started
shaving his beard for him.
4 months back his second son got married. He did not take any active part in
the wedding preparations, he was just sitting in one corner and wasn't able to
recognize people at the wedding and he only interacted with the ones who were
introduced to him by his son. 
His wife says that he kept calling out his younger son by his elder son's name
and was unable to recognize family members sometimes. He sometimes fears saying
that he can see a snake. He hasn't been buttoning and unbuttoned his shirt.
Since the past 3 months, he is unable to fold a saree without repeated
instructions. He sometimes repeats the same answer for every question asked. He
has been becoming angry for small things and he calms down within 5 to 10
minutes on his own. He stopped laughing on jokes. 
Since the past 2 months he has been using more of gestures to communicate and
his speech has become more slurred. He was throwing away his food as he was
finding it difficult to swallow it, he was even finding it difficult to swallow
liquids. There was a delay in his response to commands. He left home without
informing twice  after which he was found by his relatives and was brought
home. He has been finding it hard to urinate while he is in his pants so he has
been avoiding wearing pants, wears a lungi instead.
Since the past 1 month , the slurring of his speech increased and there was
deviation of mouth to the right because of which whatever he consumed drooled
from the left angle of his mouth. He was even found by their neighbors roaming
shirtless in a lungi since then everyone has kept an eye on him and are making
sure he doesn't leave home.
He stopped consuming alcohol 3 years back, prior to that he would consume
alcohol regularly, around 180 ml of whiskey weekly thrice.
8 years back, he left home for 4 years and he returned later by himself. On
asking the patient the details of what he did back then, he says he visited a
temple.

On presentation to us, the patient was conscious, coherent and cooperative, his
MMSE score was 9/30.  His speech was slurred, his fluency was impaired though
his comprehension and repetition were intact. He had a Waddling gait. On
performing lobe function tests, on evaluating his parietal lobe, his right to
left orientation and visuo spatial orientation and construction all apraxia was
lost and while evaluation the occipital lobe, prosopagnosia was lost. On
cranial nerves examination, there was loss of wrinkles over the left forehead
and deviation of his mouth to the right. His biceps, Triceps and supinator and
knee reflexes were exaggerated.  His metabolic profile was within the normal
range.

 

His MRI Brain showing supratentorial hydrocephalus, cerebral and cerebellar
atrophy along with chronic ischaemic changes.

He was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and was started on Tab Donepezil 10mg
once a day.
