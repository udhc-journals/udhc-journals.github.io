MEDICINE LOG BOOK BY SAI BHAVANA SANA - ROLL NUMBER - 146 This is an online E
log book to discuss our patient's de-identified health data shared after taking
his/her/guardian's signed informed consent. Here, we discuss our individual
patient's problems through series of inputs from available global online
community of experts with an aim to solve those patient's clinical problems
with collective current best evidence based inputs

**** Case discussion on right ventricular failure ****
THIS IS AN ACTIVE CASE DISCUSSION RELATED TO RIGHT VENTRICULAR FAILURE

Details related to case are present in the following linkhttps://
saikiranpatnam.blogspot.com/2020/05/medicine-case.html?m=1 and my analysis of
the case is present in the following link https://medcases.blogspot.com/2020/
06/heart-failure-3.html

Case_discussion

[31/05/20, 8:50:29 AM] Student14: 
How does Right Ventricle fails in pulmonary artery hypertension?
[31/05/20, 8:54:51 AM] Student4: In pulmonary artery hypertension there is
increased afterload to the right ventricle
[31/05/20, 9:04:04 AM] Post Residency PG1: What is afterload vs pre-load and
what is their significance in the management of heart failure?
[31/05/20, 9:06:35 AM] Student4: Afterload is resistance against which
ventricle has to pump and preload is amount of ventricular stretch
[31/05/20, 9:04:44 AM] Student9: *The heart needs to work harder to force the
blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the
right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided
heart failure, or cor pulmonale.
[31/05/20, 9:09:27 AM] Post Residency PG1: Cor pulmonale may not have failure.
What is the exact definition of cor pulmonale?
[31/05/20, 9:13:25 AM] Student12: Cor pulmonale occurs when the blood pressure
in the pulmonary artery—which carries blood from the heart to the
lungs—increases and leads to the enlargement and subsequent failure of the
right side of the heart.
[31/05/20, 9:18:40 AM] Student7: Cor pulmonale is the right heart failure when
there is primary lung disorder?
[31/05/20, 9:18:48 AM] Post Residency PG1: Why is it called cor pulmonale?
[31/05/20, 9:19:25 AM] Post Residency PG1: Does it always have to have failure?
What is the exact definition?
[31/05/20, 9:22:55 AM] Student9: COR PULMONALE
 DEFINITION
Cor pulmonale, often referred to as pulmonary heart disease. is defined as
dilation and hypertrophy of the right ventricle in response to diseases of the
pulmonary vasculature and/or lung parenchyma. Historically, this definition has
excluded congenital heart disease and those diseases in which the right heart
fails secondary to dysfunction of the left side of the heart.
[31/05/20, 9:26:36 AM] Post Residency PG1: Why is pre-load reduction an often
used strategy in heart failure other than afterload reduction?
[31/05/20, 9:27:50 AM] Post Residency PG1: Good Dr Vara. Please always share
the reference link to anything that you share that are not your original
thoughts. 
See the important thing here is dilatation and not failure?
[31/05/20, 9:30:17 AM] Student9: Harrison's tb
18th edition pg no 1913
[31/05/20, 9:06:40 AM] Student14: Why right ventricle only affected ?
[31/05/20, 9:10:08 AM] Post Residency PG1: Answer this someone
[31/05/20, 9:10:54 AM] Post Residency PG1: To put it in another way when will
the left ventricle similarly get affected?
[31/05/20, 9:11:28 AM] Student4: When there is systemic hypertension
[31/05/20, 9:12:03 AM] Student9: Structural integrity of right ventricle
[31/05/20, 9:13:01 AM] Student15: Aortic stenosis
[31/05/20, 9:13:24 AM] Student14: Yes...Right Ventricle is thinwalled
[31/05/20, 9:17:53 AM] Post Residency PG1: 
student9 now can you answer student14 question again by looking atstudent4
answer?
[31/05/20, 9:13:29 AM] Student4: When there is rt ventricular failure ,preload
to the left ventricle decreases this can lead to left ventricular failure also
[31/05/20, 9:20:48 AM] Post Residency PG1: Does reduced pre-load cause failure
or it's a strategy to treat failure?
[31/05/20, 9:22:25 AM] Student4: Reduced preload can lead to decrease in
cardiac output
[31/05/20, 9:30:47 AM] Student12: Preload reduction results in decreased
pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure and reduction of fluid transudation
into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli.
[31/05/20, 9:33:07 AM] Student13: In heart failure, preload is already elevated
due to ventricular dilation and/or increased blood volume. Hence preload
reduction will not exacerbate pulmonary or systemic congestion and edema.
[31/05/20, 9:36:36 AM] Post Residency PG1: How? Please elaborate
[31/05/20, 10:12:28 AM] Student12: decreasing preload leads to a reduction in
ventricular wall stress by decreasing the size of the heart. Reducing venous
pressure decreases proximal capillary hydrostatic pressure, which reduces
capillary fluid filtration and edema formation
