     A few common questions for the students

     1) Where are the different anatomical locations for the cause of the
     shortness of breath and palpitations for each of these patients?

     2) What is the most likely pathology and etiology in that anatomical
     location?

     3) What are the diagnostic and therapeutic options in such situations
     and what is the efficacy of each option/intervention?

     4) Please share questions that come to your mind upon going through
     each of the cases.
