**** Resolving diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties around patients with
undiagnosed undifferentiated fever ****
Problem statement :

"Fever is a common complaint in healthcare settings with various possible
aetiologies including infection, connective_tissue_disorders, malignancies, and
a number of miscellaneous conditions. The cause of fever may not be immediately
obvious because of non-specific clinical manifestations and a lack of
specificity in initial laboratory findings. The condition is referred to as
undifferentiated fever and there is a broad differential diagnosis, usually
influenced by the geographical location. Further laboratory investigations are
usually undertaken to determine the cause of fever. Sometimes, despite
iinvestigation, undifferentiated fevers remain undiagnosed, and whilst some
undiagnosed undifferentiated fevers (UUDFs) resolve spontaneously, others may
be associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality."

"Acute undifferentiated fever defined as any febrile illness for ≤ 14 days
without evidence of localized infection."

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347325/

"Current clinical guidelines provide guidance on how to manage severe illness,
common localizing infections like pneumonia and urinary tract infections, as
well as malaria. How to manage other cases of acute febrile illness is less
clear and is the focus of this review. Without an etiologic diagnosis,
clinicians frequently prescribe empiric antibiotics that may be unnecessary or
inadequate."

In the past, to help community practitioners resolve their diagnostic questions
and reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics for viral fevers, thus helping to
contain antibiotic resistance, we have suggested fever-charting and monitoring
fever patterns for two days.

AIM:

To reduce diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainity while managing patients with
acute febrile illness 

OBJECTIVES:

1. To identify various uncertainities during organ system localisation in
patients with unexplained fever during various points in the course of illness
beginning with their presentation to the hospital. 


2. To identify the role of fever diagnostic uncertainties in precipitation of
antibiotic overuse due to therapeutic uncertainty 

3) To identify possible correctable  factors to resolve diagnostic and
therapeutic uncertainty in patients with fever and thus promote antibiotic
stewardship 



PATIENTS AND METHODS:

PLACE OF STUDY: GENERAL MEDICINE DEPARTMENT

STUDY PERIOD: November 2022- October 2024

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, Observational, qualitative study

STUDY PERIOD – over 2 years

antibacterials and antimalarials) 


Clinical complexity consists of a few defining characteristics such as
uncertainty, non linearity, unpredictability and yet an overall pattern leading
to resolution through attractor states over time. (2) As physician attractors
we are uniquely privileged to "be" with our patients regardless of the
diagnosis and that is the only way we may know our patient's outcomes where our
"being" with them is the most significant (and often overlooked) intervention.
