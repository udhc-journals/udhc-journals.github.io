****** RISHIK
R.no: 37 ******

****** 23 yr Old male with Bilateral Lower limb weakness.  ******

I've been given this case to solve in an attempt to understand the topic of
"patient clinical data analysis" to develop my competency in reading and
comprehending clinical data including history, clinical findings,
investigations and come up with a diagnosis and treatment plan.

After going through the patient details as given by our Intern Mam through the
following link..
https://vaish7.blogspot.com/2020/05/medicine.html?m=1

My analysis of the patient is as follows,

***** Chief Complaints:  *****
*****  *Bilateral Lower limb weakness.  *****
Bilateral Lower limb weakness associated with Tingling and Numbness since 5
days. 
There is also H/O Sudden fall. 

As described by the patient, there is intially Paraparesis that gradually
developed into Paraplegia.

**** Paraparesis can be due to ****
1. Injury 
- Which is ruled out as there is no H/O trauma. 

2. Vitamin B12 deficiency
- Which is ruled out as there is no Pallor suggestive of Anemina

3. PVD
- A sudden fall may be indicative of vascular cause probably due to stroke or
ischemia or infarcts in the brain. 
- However it can be ruled out as there is no signs of pain, claudication, skin
changes in leg.

4. Neuromuscular Problem 
- Since there is tingling and numbness it is more of a nerve issue. 
- O/E of CNS ,
# Higher Mental Functions: 
Patient is Conscious, Oriented to time place and person, Speech & Memory
normal. 

# Cranial Nerves: Intact

# Motor System:
                         Right.                      Left
Bulk:               Normal.               Normal
Tone:

           UL.          5/5.                     5/5
           LL.           2/5.                    0/5
Reflexes.  
   Superficial reflexes
                       Right.                     Left
Corneal.            P                            P

    Deep tendon reflexes 
                          Right                     Left
Biceps.                2+                         1+
Triceps.              2+                         1+
Supinator.         3+                         2+
Knee                   3+                         2+
Ankle.                 3+                         2+
jaw jerk.             1+.                        1+
Ankle clonus   PRESENT        Absent
 
Primitive reflex - absent. 
Involuntary movements - absent. 

# Sensory System: Normal. 

# Coordinaton: Normal

# Gait: ??

# Meningeal Signs: Absent

From the Nervous system examination mentioned above it is evident that there is
•B/L Hypotonia, Suggestive of LMN lesions
•Hyper reflexia of Knee and Ankle reflex suggestive of lesion UMN lesion above
L3,L4
• Ankle clonus, suggestive of UMN lesion above S1,S2

**** Investigations: ****
MRI of Spine

***** *Vomitings *****
Though patient mentioned it as a Non projectile vomiting, it is difficult to
rely on patients information who might not actually know what a projectile
vomiting is like. 
These Vomitings may be due to intracranial space occupying lesions which causes
raised intracranial pressure and vomitings.

**** Investigations: ****
MRI of Brain

**** *Gluteal abcess  ****
 Operated 5 months back
**** *scrotal abcess  ****
   Operated 10days back

These two abcess are cold abcess as there is no signs of inflammation.

**** Investigations: ****
Scraping of the abcess peripherally and send for culture to isolate the
organism causing abcess.

**** Interpretation of Investigations: ****
Upon going through the investigations it is found that
There is significant enhancement which represents meningeal enhancement or
exudates and following lesions in mri with multiple nodules in pulmonary
apices  suggest of pulmonary kochs and disseminated tuberculosis. 

So the patient is now found to have Tuberculosis but didn't have any classical
findings of TB.

As it is mentioned that patient has H/O Multiple Sex partners it is advised to
go for HIV testing as HIV and TB co-exist. PLHIV are 21 (16-27) times at higher
risk of developing TB¹.

**** Further analysis: ****
•As the patient is found to have disseminated TB, it is important to ruleout TB
Spine (Potts Spine)
Potts spine may cause Potts paraplegia involving both the lower limbs. 
•Its is also important to ruleout Spondylodiscitis as M.tuberculosis is one of
the main causative organism³.

**** Discussion: ****
•Anatomical location of the casue is most likely at the level of L3,L4. 
However there must be lesion involving more than one level since the patient
has features of both UMN & LMN lesions. 

•Etiologically it can be due to Disseminated TB
Potts paraplegia is yet to be evaluated and ruled out. 

•Pathologically the cause can be due to Clod abscess caused by MTB extending to
more than one level 
i.e, Above and At the level of L4,L5.

**** Therapeutic Options: ****
•Medical management
Manage TB : ATT + Rest + Taylars Brace for 18-24 months
•Surgical management
Anterolateral Decompression. 
(Indicated if, No improvement with 3-6 weeks of treatment, Symptoms worsen
during treatment, Bowel and Bladder involvement). 

UPDATE :

•On further follow up, Upper limb reflexes were found to be exaggerated which
made us to think again regarding the site of lesion, 

•All the features of CNS examination now point towards UMN lesion (Hypotonia,
though  not a feature of UMN lesion, can be seen in acute cases of UMN lesions
due to Spinal Shock). 

•So now the lesion can be anywhere from Cerebral cortex to down the
Corticospinal tracts. 

•However here the patient has Involvement of Upper and Lower limbs without any
involvement of abdominal muscles in between, we can rule out the lesion in the
tracts. 
If the lesion is in Tracts then there should be involvement of all the muscles
below the lesion which is not happening in our patient. 

• Now we can think that the lesion is in the cerebral cortex in the motor area.

• As Upper and Lower limbs are involved the lesion must be in the motor area
controlling these regions, i.e., in the medial part of the Motor Homenculus.

Motor Homenculus⁴

oDw7RYY4t2w6FlmhYfQVGMYIR99C9aIDQCK4BGAsYHg/s320/images.jpeg]


As we can see from the above picture that the Upper and Lower limb regions are
side by side a lesion in that region of the Motor Cortex can lead to
involvement of Upper and Lower limbs. 

• The next Question is
WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF LESION?
 As the patient has Tuberculosis the MTB can cause a lesion in that area. 

HOW DOES IT SPREAD TO THAT AREA?
 It is through a Blood borne spread through the ACA. 

Diagnosis :

TUBERCULAR_ACA_VASCULITIS_in_the_medial_Homenculus_area_of_cerebral_cortex


Cerebral Vasculitis secondary to Tuberculosis in previous literature

   1. RishikMay_22,_2020_at_10:14 PM
      [5/22, 10:46 AM] : Gud Morning Sir,
      In our case of 23 yr patient with lower limb weakness
      Why was an MRI of spine not done?
      It is also possible that he might have Potts paraplegia, Presence of
      Ankle clonus and exaggerated DTR are earliest neurological signs
      indicating a SC compression.
      [5/22, 10:48 AM] : Also it would be better to have an Orthopedic opinion
      to rule out Potts paraplegia. Because if it is there and is not
      identified it would involve Bowel and Bladder in long term and if it's
      Potts paraplegia it can be managed surgically.
      [5/22, 10:50 AM] : Also Gait is to be evaluated to see if there is any TB
      spondylitis
      [5/22, 4:28 PM] Rakesh Sir KIMS: Orthopedic opinion for Potts paraplegia?
      ��

      Well their opinion is only asked if we want them to operate, otherwise we
      need to make the diagnosis for them ourselves first
      [5/22, 4:30 PM] Rakesh Sir KIMS: Ask Hitesh to share with you the MR
      spine images.

      The MRI spine lumbar vertebral involvement is mentioned in his mri report
      that is already in the log.

      However that may not be causing his paraparesis. Can you tell why?
      [5/22, 4:31 PM] Rakesh Sir KIMS: Ask Hitesh to share his gait video or at
      least mention what was his gait like
      [5/22, 4:31 PM] : Sure sir
      [5/22, 4:31 PM] : May be it's not compressing the cord
      [5/22, 4:32 PM] Rakesh Sir KIMS: Ok so back to the first question
      [5/22, 4:33 PM] : Sir but the lesion is definitely peripheral na Sir
      [5/22, 4:34 PM] : If it's a central lesion the presentation would be far
      different with involvement of other structures
      [5/22, 4:35 PM] : There is a chace of disc inflammation spondylodiscitis
      [5/22, 4:35 PM] : But that is usually more common in immunocompromised
      patients
      [5/22, 4:35 PM] : I think we also need to assess the patients HIV status
      tooo
      [5/22, 4:36 PM] : To consider few other differentials
      [5/22, 4:43 PM] Rakesh Sir KIMS: Yes so the most basic thing in mbbs
      neurology that we need to learn to distinguish is between peripheral LMN
      lesion and central UMN lesion.

      What does his clinical features suggest?
      [5/22, 4:46 PM] : Sir
      From the Nervous system examination mentioned above it is evident that
      there is
      •B/L Hypotonia, Suggestive of LMN lesions
      •Hyper reflexia of Knee and Ankle reflex suggestive of lesion UMN lesion
      above L3,L4
      • Ankle clonus, suggestive of UMN lesion above S1,S2
      [5/22, 4:47 PM] : I think there is lesion just above L3,L4 in the spinal
      cord that reflects as UMN lesion for the levels below it.
      [5/22, 4:50 PM] Rakesh Sir KIMS: Good above L3, L4 where?
      [5/22, 4:59 PM] : Just above L3,L4 but not likely disturbing the L2
      Because if L2 in involved in the lesion then
      There should be sensory loss on antero lateral aspect of thigh upto level
      of knee(Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh-L2,3)
      Also loss of sensation over the medial aspect of thigh( Obturator nerve-
      L2,3,4)
      [5/22, 5:00 PM] : As there is no sensory deficit it is likely that the
      sensations are preserved due to normal L2
      [5/22, 5:04 PM] : Also involvement of L3,4 explain the weakness in lower
      limb caused due to loss of motor fibers of obturator nerve to thigh
      muscle
