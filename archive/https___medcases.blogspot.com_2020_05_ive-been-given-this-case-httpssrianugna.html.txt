MEDICINE LOG BOOK BY SAI BHAVANA SANA - ROLL NUMBER - 146 This is an online E
log book to discuss our patient's de-identified health data shared after taking
his/her/guardian's signed informed consent. Here, we discuss our individual
patient's problems through series of inputs from available global online
community of experts with an aim to solve those patient's clinical problems
with collective current best evidence based inputs

**** PARAPARESIS ****
"I've been given this case
 https://srianugna.blogspot.com/2020/05/hello-everyone.htmll
https://youtu.be/3VVH7w3rWSM
 to solve in an attempt to understand the topic of "paraparesis."

This may develop my competency in

a) reading and comprehending clinical data related to "paraparesis" including
history, clinical findings, investigations

b) come up with a diagnosis such as:
1) Anatomical location of the root cause
2) Physiological functional disability
3) Biochemical abnormalities that could be a root cause at a molecular level
4) Pathology that could reflect the root cause at a cellular level

c) a treatment plan for each of these patients of paraparesis that can have a
pharmacological and non pharmacological component.

d) learning the scientific basis of diagnostic and therapeutic approach in
terms of past collective experiences and experiments (aka evidence based
medicine).

Following is my analysis of patient's problem.

Patient is 18 year old came with the complaint of bilateral lower limb weakness
which is chronic and insidious and progressive in nature.With this complaint of
weakness what comes to my mind is invovement of nervous system.

Any lesion in the motor system can lead to :
[https://teachmephysiology.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/
1426_Corticospinal_Pathway-468x1024.jpg]
    * plegia 
    * paresis - In this patient it is paraplegia(bilateral lower limb weakness)
    * involuntary movements
**** UPPER_MOTOR_NEURON  ****
A neuron that extends from cerebral cortex(motor) to brainstem or spinal cord
is known as upper motor neuron.

If there is lesion in this area, patient can present with following signs and
symptoms:

    * mostly distal muscle involvement
    * apraxia
    * flexor weakness in lower limb
    * no muscle atrophy
    * hypertonia 
    * spasticity(clasp knife spasticity)
    * deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated
    * babinki is present
    * clonus:sustained
    *  abdominal reflexes are absent  
(This image is taken from   https://teachmephysiology.com/nervous-system/motor-
system/upper-motor-neurone/ )             
History related to present case
    * history of difficulty in performing squatting
    * history of wearing and holding of chappal
    * no history of difficulty in buttoning and unbuttoning shirt -suggestive
      of no distal muscle involvement in upper limb
    * no history of difficulty in combing hair-suggestive of no proximal muscle
      involvement on upper limbs
    * muscle atrophy is present-not suggestive of UMN lesion
    * hypotonia is present-not suggestive of UMN lesion
    * reflexes are absent-not suggestive of UMN lesion
Therefore, due to above finding I ELIMINATE UPPER MOTOR NEURON LESION.
****  BASAL_GANGLIA ****
Basal ganglia is mainly involved voluntary control of movements.Lesion is the
basal ganglia can present as following:
    * Athetosis
    * Chorea
    * Ballismus
    * Dystonia
    * Resting tremors
    * Bradykinesia
    * Rigidity
History related to present case

 Patient did not have any of the above conditions, so I RULE OUT LESION OF
BASAL GANGLIA.
**** CEREBELLUM ****
Cerebellum is mainly involved in motor learning,sense of body position,fine
movement coordination,balance and equilibrium.


Lesion in cerebellum can present with following signs:
    * [Nonmotor_Functions_of_the_Cerebellum:_An_Introduction_|_American_...]
    * Dysmetria
    * Dysdiadokinasia
    * Gait abnormalities
    * Hypotonia
    * Dysarthria 
    * Nystagmus
    * Intension tremors
    * Pendular knee jerk

History related to present case
    * ataxic gait is not present  (For more informaation about gait- https://
      stanfordmedicine25.stanford.edu/the25/gait.html)
    * no history of any other above mentioned signs
Therefore, due to above findings,I RULE OUT CEREBELLAR INVOLVEMENT.

**** LOWER_MOTOR_NEURON ****
 A neuron that extends from spinal cord or brainstem to muscle is know as lower
motor neuron.

If there is lesion this area, patient can present with following signs and
symptoms: 
    * mostly proximal muscle are involved
    * atrophy of mucles
    * flaccidity
    * hypotonia
    * deep tendon reflexes are reduced or absent
    * babinski is negative
    * fasiculations and fibrillations are present
History related to the present case   

    * history of weakness in proximal region followed by distal region (lower
      limb) is present
    * atrophy is present
    * deep tendon reflexes are absent(areflexia)
These features are suggestive of LOWER MOTOR NEURON LESION.

 As this is LMN  lesion next step is to know at which site of lower motor
neuron pathology is present.

History related to present case                              

    * history of symmetrical weakness of lower limbs
    * history of proximal muscle weakness followed by distal muscle weakness 
    * no history of loss of sensation( no H/O numbness,tingling,pin and needles
      sensation,burning pain,tight band like pressure and insensitivity to
      cold)
    * areflexia is present
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:

    * Myopathy
    * Demyelinating peripheral neuropathy
**** Demyelinating_peripheral_neuropathy ****
It is the involvement of demyelinated neurons.In the present case as it is
chronic paraplegia it could be CIPD.

Signs and symptoms
    * Both proximal and distal weakness
    * Areflexia
    * No atrophy
    * Motor system is predominent than sensory
Investigations
    * CSF analysis-increase in protiens
    * EMG and NCS-latency and decreased conduction velocity
Investigation that is performed is EMG which showed normal.
As EMG is normal there is no invovement of peripheral nerves.So I RULE OUT
CIPD.


*** MYOPATHY ***

History related to present case
    * history of persistent bilateral weakness of proximal lower limb followed
      by distal
    * buckling gait
    * no history of any drug intake
    * history of pedal edema is present 
    * cardiomyopathy is present
Differential diagnosis
    * Polymyositis
    * Hypothyriodism
    * Becker muscular dystrophy
Investigations:

 I would like to order following investigations:
    * Thyroid profile
    * muscle biopsy to find any inflammatory cause
    * Chest X -ray
    * CPK
    * EMG
    * genetic testing for becker muscular dystrophy
Investigations that are done are

    * Muscle biopsy

Muscle biopsy rules out polymyopathy.
**** BECKER_MUSCULAR_DYSTROPHY ****
It is a X-linked recessive inherited dystrophy characterized by weakness and
wasting of skeletal and cardiac muscles.It is caused by DMD gene mutation.It
has variable disease onset.
Signs_and_symptoms
    * muscle wasting
    * cardiomyopathy 
    * arrythmias
    * scoliosis
    * features of myopathy
Investigations
    * CK-MB
    * EMG
    * Muscle biopsy
    * Chest x-ray
    * genetic testing
Treatment
    * Physiotherapy

Edits:

As NCS are normal,I rule out CIPD.

      OUT CIPD."

      This will be NCV not EMG

      diseases..DIABETES, CANCER,  HIV/AIDS, HERPES HEPATITiS A AND B. FEVER,
      EPILEPSY, MENINGITIS, DENGUE SCHIZOPHRENIA, PROSTATE, THYROID, BACTERIA,
      MALARIA, DICK AND BREAST ENLARGEMENT,MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, TUBERCULOSIS,
      DIARRHEA, POLIO, LOW BLOOD PRESSURE,  INSOMNIA,ARTHMA, LUPUS,  RABIES,
      JOINT PAIN, STOMACH PAIN, HYPEROPIA, ANTI VIRUS, MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY,
      HEART DISEASE, CHRONIC DISEASE,EPILEPSY, LUPUS, STROKE, SPINAL CORD
      INJURY, ECZEMA, KIDNEY DISEASE, ACME,  KAWASAKI, BACK PAIN etc. why don't
      you contact dr.Akhigbe today and be free from your diseases because he is
      very good and honest Doctor and he is also called the godfather of herbal
      root contact him via email; drrealakhigbe@gmail.com or whatsApp him on
