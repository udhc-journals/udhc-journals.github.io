Obstetric history-
She delivered a healthy female baby through NVD when she was 16 yrs old. The
female baby is now 16yrs old and is doing well. The baby was breast fed for an
year and then stopped as she got pregnant again. At the time of her first
pregnancy the patient was asked to take ?anti D antibodies in v/o Rh negative
pregnancy but she dint.
She is an O negative female.

She got pregnant again the 2nd time,This time at 8th month of GA an emergency
LSCS was performed in v/o IUD and she delivered a dead female baby.She was
advised for Hysterectomy at this point but they denied for it. About 2 units of

patient.Lactation was suppressed with medication.

She got pregnant the 3rd time 3 yrs after her 2nd pregnancy, but got aborted at
3rd month in v/o fetal anomalies.This time an induction of labour was done.

She then had her last pregnancy i.e 4th pregnancy 7 yrs back which was a
complicated pregnancy. She was given Anti D antibodies at 7th month and she
delivered a healthy male baby through LSCS at 9th month. LSCS was done as there
was premature rupture of membranes and then after LSCS she was hysterectomised

7 units of blood. She developed generalised edema as said by the patient for
which she was treated and then all the sympyoms mentioned in the history of
