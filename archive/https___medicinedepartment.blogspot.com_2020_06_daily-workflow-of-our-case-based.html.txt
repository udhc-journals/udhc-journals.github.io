**** Daily workflow of our case based blended learning ecosystem aka CBBLE ****
Sharing our current regular blended learning workflow locally centred around
our rural medical college and globally part of an online learning ecosystem of
multiple medical college students and faculty.

Precovid it was difficult to get an online learning audience formally of our UG
students but post covid the tables have turned and we have formally started
engaging the 200 UG student batches currently stranded in their homes, semester
wise and my description of our current workflow will be centered around our
patients as well as our UGs in 8th semester Medicine as well as interns and
three batches of PG students. 

Our regular patient centered learning workday begins with our post graduate
residents meeting our patients in the wards and ICUs from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM
while one unit batch of post graduates look after the outpatient that opens at
9:00 AM.  A tabular summary of our daily workflow is linked in the bottom of
this piece and one can skip the long rant with even longer rants intertwined in
weblinks below and jump straight to it and then return to the rant for
clarifications if necessary. 

In non covid times there was a central academic session supposed to be held
daily for all departments to showcase their own workflow based learning
experiences over the week or month following which the consultant rounds begin
by 10:00 AM to review the system 1 plan generated by the 8:00 to 9:00 AM post
graduate resident rounds through system 2 Socratic questioning. 

Here's some detailed discussion quoted below between the two systems of
cognition aka dual process theory of cognition and decision making. 

"System 1:  intuition or pattern-recognition
System 2: Analytical critical appraisal
Reference: Systems 1 and 2 thinking processes and cognitive reflection testing
in medical students
Can Med Educ J. 2016 Oct; 7(2): e97–e103. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/
articles/PMC5344059/#__ffn_sectitle

UG teaching learning workflow in medicine begins at 11:00 -1:00 PM post 8-10
AM- PG rounds and 10-11AM- UG case taking followed by 11:00-1:00 AM unit wise
UG case presentation and discussion, which is currently not happening as the
UGs are locked down. 

However we have the 2-4 pm-intern PG sessions daily where our interns and PGs
present cases and there is an offline active learning discussion that is
recorded on video and shared globally online through YouTube and all our active
learning videos can be accessed here: https://www.youtube.com/
playlist?list=PLvOgc9_v4PCKsIrVK4laA3_rUJOMPAYKJ

The interns also record the same patients in their online log book portfolios
and these online patient logs are fed to the UGs along with the links to online
videos of the active offline learning sessions around the same case. Will share
the illustrative links below along with the questions posed to the UGs for
their solving and discussion and represention in their own UG online learning
portfolios or E log books. Again can share all those samples 200 of which are
currently available online. 

Some of it has been detailed and made public here: https://www.quora.com/How-
helpful-is-the-online-education-system-during-covid-19-for-medical-students-
who-should-learn-more-from-their-postings-and-develop-skills-in-the-very-
hospital

The learning strategy also engages peer to peer and higher up by asking the UGs
to share their logged thoughts and queries with the interns, pgs and faculty of
the treating unit of the patient under discussion. The assessment is completely
formative again done by the treating unit who can actually utilize the inputs
of the UGs on their own patients. 

The assessment includes following broad competencies 

a) The student's approach to the clinical problem which needs competency in all
MBBS subjects beginning with anatomy to first make an anatomical diagnosis
followed by competency in pathophysiology and microbiology for the etiologic
diagnosis and finally EBM for weighing in on the diagnostic sensitivity
specificity as well as competency in handling pharmacological and non
pharmacological interventions along with an ability to guage their efficacy
using RCT data. 

b) Originality of thought and ability to generate useful questions around the
patient especially for the patient treating team 

c) Ability to engage in active learning discussion with the treating team
through asynchronous non intrusive text messages that are also logged and
shared for evaluation (illustrative samples available). 

Summative assessment would involve testing their ability to do the above in a
smaller time frame and it will simulate a single post in their current online
learning portfolio. And real formative assessment would also document their
regular competencies in individual patient data collection (currently being
done by the interns) and not just their competencies in individual patient data
analysis. 

Our current university PG theory exams have been postponed indefinitely but I
don't see any reason why we can't implement the same strategy of summative
assessments as mentioned above, which will be a better marker of their
competencies and we can include the procedural videos they have themselves
performed routinely during their training (as formative assessment). 

We have published the earlier version of our case based blended learning
ecosystem before and reshare the link here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/
articles/PMC6163835/

We currently also include the discussion of one PG thesis research project in
our regular 2-4 PM active learning sessions that are video uploaded and can be
found in the link to all our videos shared above. 

Here is a tabular summary link of the above rant https://docs.google.com/

Here's the detailed MCI guideline based rationale for the same roster
