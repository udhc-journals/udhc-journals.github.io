1)Anatomical diagnosis -? Glomerulus of kidney                                
                                   Etiological diagnosis -  ?? Nephrotic
syndrome secondary to the diabetic nephropathy or CKD.   

  2)Reasons for I) Azotemia : impaired renal excretion of urea and creatinine
secondary to CKD.

 II) Anemia : decreased erythropoietin. 

III) Hypoalbunemia: capillary basement membrane and podocytes damage.kidney
cannot filter protein                                
Acidosis-accumulation of H+ and loss of HCO3
3) Rationale : syp potchlor was given because of the hypokalemia.. Inj. NaHCO3
was given because of metabolic acidosis ..Insulin and antihypertensives are
given because known case of DM and HTN. Orofer XT was given because of anemia..
Inj. Lasix was given to decrease her volume overload. Spironolactone was given
it was a potassium sparing diuretic.Calcium was given to the patient  because
of hypocalcemia secondary to CKD. Indications of NaHCO3:metabolic acidosis in
cardiac arrest, Tricyclic antidepressants, aspirin and phenobarbitone
overdoses, Hyperkalemia, Crush injuries, C/I  in certain conditions because of
adverse reactions like Hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, cellulitis,
seizures, Tetany, sodium retention, peripheral edema.             

         4) indication of dialysis in this pt: worsening of SOB secondary to
metabolic acidosis with Anuria not resolved with high ceiling
diuretics...Crucial factor: pt became symptomatic on 3rd day....          

                            5) Causes of same condition : primary : Minimal
change disease, Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Membranous nephropathy.  
 Secondary : DM, SLE, HIV , Viral hepatitis, malaria, amyloidosis,
 Sarcoidosis, Drugs : Nsaids, gold, pencillamine Cancer: Hodgkin's and non
Hodgkin's, solid tumours of GIT, RCC and lung.

6)expected outcomes of ckd patients depend upon age,genes,associated co
morbidities                                   This patients condition may
deteriorate due to pleural effusion

7)association of ckd with hrpef

Activation of raas system

Anemia 

Hypercalcemia 

Hyperphosphatemia

Uremic toxins .these critically discuss the potentail contribution to coronary
dysfunction, left ventricular stiffening  and delayed left ventricular
relaxation

8)mean Hemoglobin levels,before and after study,in rhuepo group we’re 8.85+ or
- 1.01g/do and 9.90+ or - 0.29 g/dl,respectively(p less than 0.001) and in
control group were,9.00+ or -g/dl and 7.81 + or - g/dl,respectively

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293514/

9)Anaemia contributes to the impairment of health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) in patients with CKD [7]. Its impact on patients’ HRQoL burden is
exacerbated by reduced physical capacity and energy levels among these
patients.

10)Malnutrition is an important complication in CRI patients and ESRD patients
on dialysis. SGA is a reliable method of assessing nutritional status. Most
important is the fact that it can detect the changing trend of nutritional
status, which may be missed by one-time anthropometry and biochemical methods.

11)this 58M had history of fever with cought and elevated tlc with indiacates
renal acute kidney injury.As well there is no albuminuria,no edema

In 45M had had pedal edema ,facial piffiness,abdominal distention,anuria with
clearly indicates nephrotic nephritic syndrome.and investigations showed that
there is microalbuminuria,micro haematuria.Therapy in is patient  

Etilogy of renal failure in 58M could be fever associated with cough which
might have increased leucocyte count and caused renal aki

This is an online E log book to discuss our patient's de-identified health data
shared after taking his/her/guardian's signed informed consent.  Here we
discuss our individual patient's problems through series of inputs from
available global online community of experts with an aim to solve those
patient's clinical problems with collective current best evidence based
inputs.  This E log book also reflects my patient-centered online learning
portfolio and your valuable inputs on the comment box is welcome. Here is a
case i have seen: A 22 year old man  presented with the chief complaint of
generalized edema since 2 weeks.  The youngest of 4 and working as a cashier
patient reported to work as usual 2 weeks ago, when his friends asked if he
overslept and developed a puffy face. Puzzled, the patient immediately saw
himself in the mirror and noticed that he had periorbital edema under both
eyes. He did not have any rash, lip swelling or difficulty in chewing or pain
in jaws

occupation  came to opd with complaint of pain in multiple joints associated
with restriction of movement   Patient was apparently asymptomatic 10 yrs back
.Then he felt pain in bilateral knee joints which is associated with
swelling.for which he used medication (proper records not available about
medication)which gave him mild symptomatic relief but not completely cured his
pain. Patie
