**** Whatsapp physician's disclaimer ****
Disclaimer by the telephysician in whatsapp after providing any kind of long
distance information support (feel free to plagiarise if you engage in long
distance patient information support aka Telemedicine in the stone age):

"Always be in touch with your local physician and inform him her about any
decision that you take and essentially keep him her in the loop (even if it's
in whatsapp) as the local physician can respond immediately physically in case
of any sudden physical unpredictable issues).

Meanwhile I am happy to continue to support informationally from my long
distance perch. 👍

PS: No issues with trespassing on this intellectual property but in keeping
with "creative commons" laws please acknowledge this  whatsapp message in your
quotes.
