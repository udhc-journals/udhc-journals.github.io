     consisting of MBBS and MD students, question senior residents,
      independent researchers and faculty Professors in global locations
     but maximum represented from Indian subcontinent as well as Europe,
     US, Australia


     Conversational learning outcomes:


     Dr Ambarish Bhattacharya presents the patient data:

     "65yrs male known DM, HTN, COPD, Parkinson's.
     H/o fall followed by # neck femur. Hemiarthroplasty done. Patient
     discharged after 4 days on Amoxyclav but found drowsy on discharge so
     brought to another center and admitted under me. On examination 103F
     temperature and GCS 12/15, Mild generalized rigidity, anemia, few
     crepts bilaterally, tenderness in operation site and large bed
     sore.Gave Paracetamol, fever came down and patient became 15/15 GCS.
     Thinking of Hospital acquired infection gave him Meropenem + Doxy +
     Clindamycin for 1 week. But fever recurs as soon as PCM/NSAIDS is
     stopped. 
     Hb 8, TLC 13500, PLC 200000, ESR 125, CRP 200. Malaria, Dengue, Blood
     cs, Urine cs all negative. CXR, USG abdomen NAD. Renal and LFT
     normal.
     Did CT chest small effusion and small consolation left lower zone.
     Did CT of operated hip. Small collection near femur. Too little fluid
     for diagnostic tap.
     CRP is progressively increasing (now 320) with normal Procal (1) and
     high Ferritin (5300). TLC was 10500. Albumin 2.4, Sugar well
     controlled. Now on Colistin + Tigecycline + Linezolid.
     Orthopedic surgeons say no intervention from their part. Bone marrow
     planned.

     Would be grateful for ideas in further management."


     Active participants inputs:

Rakesh Biswas, Professor Medicine 

     How is the patient now? A fever pattern data on regular monitoring
     would have been useful

     Response to input 1 from Dr Ambarish Bhattacharya 

Rakesh Biswas Patient has expired

Ultimately got: Arthroplasty associated infection, Aspirated pneumoniae leading
to severe sepsis and MODS

Input 2 from Anupam Halder, AIIMs Bhopal 
 
Sir did we find the pathogen a/w sepsis?

Input 3 from Arvindran Alaga
Fellow, Respiratory Medicine

Any Echocardiography  was done?

 
Input 4 from Dr. Sushma Sapkota Pandey, an Internal Medicine Specialist in
Boonville, New York. 

Did we rule out Stills disease? 

Input 5 from Harinder Singh 

USG abdomen? 

Tarun Chakrabarti 

Did you ask for CPK? NMS could be superimposed on sepsis.


Input from Nitin Garg, Neurosurgeon, Bhopal 

Ambarish Bhattacharya sorry to hear that the patient expired. Any CSF analysis
done as these procedures are done under spinal anaesthesia to rule out
meningitis?

Input from Anupam Halder, AIIMS, Bhopal 
Sir do we rule out meningitis in absence of any localizing history of
meningitis?

Input 7 from Gaurav Sharma, Orthopedic surgeon, Lucknow 

Sorry to hear the patient expired...read this message only today...I have been
associated with a cardiac centre where I routinely manage  ortho cases with
such morbidities.
If the duration between the occurance of fracture and admission to hospital is
prolonged...such cases very commonly come to hospital with bedsores and a bad
chest. Optimization of such patients to near normal..no matter how long it
takes to do so...is the key to prevent SIRS n MODS. Also in such cases one has
to keep the duration of surgery short.
I wished to throw some light on the prevention part rather than the treatment
hence this post
