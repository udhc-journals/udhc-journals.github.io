**** Case based online learning assignment for 8th semesters this week : Three
patients of paraparesis ****
Last week we had three patients of paraparesis admitted with us and our interns
have shared it in their E logs below for the online 8th semester students to go
through this week and answer some of the case related questions and also come
out with their own queries:

A few common questions for the 8th semester students

1) Where are the three different anatomical locations for the cause of the
paraparesis for each of these patients?

2) What is the most likely pathology and etiology in that anatomical location?

3) What are the therapeutic options in such situations?

4) Please share questions that come to your mind upon going through each of the
cases.

Each 8th semester student will share their answers in their own E logs. Thanks
to all the 8th semester students for sharing all their 200 web based logs that
will remain as their 'online learning portfolios,' and will be very useful
toward their formative assessment in the coming months and years. More here:

and.html?m=1

Once the 8th semesters join hospital duties they will be expected to evaluate
their own patients in the wards and create their own patient online records.
