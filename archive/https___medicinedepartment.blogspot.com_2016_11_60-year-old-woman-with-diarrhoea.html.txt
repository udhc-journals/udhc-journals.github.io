Rakesh_Biswas Yes Boudhayan we need not get the UGs to dig too deep into each
topic but just become aware on the kind of information one needs to have while
caring for their patients? At least they get a chance to learn that a patient
is not just HCV but also a conglomeration of anemia and a sudden diarhhoea and
so many other aspects that we have not even been able to identify in this (and
our other patients).

had already received blood transfusion before our first evaluation on the day
after admission.........So we had identified everything at the onset itself

Rakesh_Biswas Yes Dr Dibyajyoti and Dr Boudhayan we may end up putting her on
daily sofosbuvir 400 mg and daclatasvir 60 mg, for 12 weeks (and as she is a
decompensated cirrhotic addition of Ribavirin 600 mg to begin with and then
gradually adjusted to 1000 mg). This is true for most genotypes except 3. For
genotype 3 the duration would be 24 weeks. More here:http://www.easl.eu/medias/

RadhaKrishan_Dhiman This patient requires all 3 drugs for treatment. However we
need to maintain Hb above 9-10 g/dl. Diarrhoea part needs to investigated and
treated. Look for IgA tTG as well. Duration of treatment with antivirals is 6
months. Ribavirin should be started with 600 then build up further. 
Needs good imaging, CTP AND MELD calculations and work up for liver
transplantation. They improve with treatment to the extent that liver Tx could
be avoided in 50-60 % of patients.

Rakesh_Biswas Thanks Dr Dhiman for these very useful pointers. Bimleshplease
let us know her current Hb. Her diarrhoea appeared to be acute and had subsided
during her last admission. This time her anasarca is persistent and her right
lower limb edema appears to be greater than her left (and we want to
investigate her for a DVT as well). Lets hope she is one of those 50% who can
do without the liver transplant even at this juncture. Dr Dipenduwould be also
good to have your inputs.
