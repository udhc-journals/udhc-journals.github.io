clinical problem with current best evidence based input.

This Elog also reflects my patient centered online learning portfolio.

“patient clinical data analysis” to develop my competency in reading and
comprehending clinical data including history, clinical findings,
investigations, and come up with a diagnosis and treatment plan.
