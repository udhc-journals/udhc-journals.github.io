DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL MEDICINE
INTERNAL ASSESSMENT EXAM FOR 1st and 2nd YEAR PG STUDENTS

Answer all questions                                                           
                        Max Marks: 60
Time: 2pm to 4pm                                                               
                       Date: 01.02.2020


There are in total ‘3’ questions. The 3 long questions are 20 marks each
with two parts of 10 marks, one specifically related to the case and the other
more general as per tradition. The paper is designed to be answered by you in a
blended offline and online format. Most of the real patient data presented here
is due to our hardworking interns who have obtained signed informed consent
from patients and then captured deidentified history and images. It has been
shared nearly unchanged with minimal editing. 

Q1. A 50 year old man with progressive abdominal pain with vomiting since last
3 months and tenderness in the paraumbilical  region with no history suggestive
of sepsis. On CT abdomen, patient was found to have a large cystic lesion in
right hypochondrium possibly arising as a sequelae of pancreatic inflammation.
Patient was admitted and put on injection taxim and injection tramadol for last
7 days.

a) Please check out the CT images of the abdomen (also check radspa and discuss
with the Radiology PGs for the entire set of images)

 and write the answers to the following: 

Where is the cyst anatomically located in relation to the pancreas? Is it in
the greater sac or lesser sac or both? If in greater sac is it communicating
with the pancreatic duct? Why is it not causing pancreatic ascites? What would
be the disadvantages of an external drainage in such a situation? If planning
internal drainage given the CT findings what would be the disadvantages of a
cystogastrostomy vs cystojejunostomy? (3 marks) 


b) Is there a role of antibiotics in Pseudocyst without any evidence of sepsis?
Please substantiate with evidence from review of literature (3 marks) 


c) What is the role of aspiration in management of an infected Pseudocyst? 
Please substantiate with evidence from review of literature (2 marks) 

d) What is the role of prophylactic antibiotics in intestinal obstruction? 
Please substantiate with evidence from review of literature (2 marks) 

Short note: Peritoneal relations with pancreas. (3 marks) 

Pancreatic pseudocyst (3 marks) 

ERCP and pancreatic duct (2 marks) 

Role of pancreatic necrosectomy (2 marks) 

Q2. A 55yr old male patient with diabetes since 7 yrs presented with c/
o vomitings since 1 day(20 episodes non projectile and bilious) with right
sided weakness and headache since 1 day .3 yrs back he had right sided weakness
,squint and weak memory for which he was admitted in a pvt hospital and
diagnosed as acute cva for which he used allopathic medication for 2 months and
ayurvedic medication for 3 yrs .he was asymptomatic for those 3 yrs but 1 week
ago on 27/01/2020 he had 20 episodes of vomitings,non projectile and bilious,
and a grbs of 300+ (tested at home with a glucometer )and developed slurred
speech for which he was immediately taken to an rmp and given iv fluids
overnight and  referred to our hospital in the morning.patient consumes alcohol
occassionally and consumes chewable tobbacco since 30yrs. (History taken by
intern)

   1. Please examine the clinical images of his neurological findings during
      this admission and answer the following questions:
Higher mental functions: MMSE15
Cranial nerve examination: Inability to adduct the left eyeball with visible
nystagmus in the right eye ball. Bilateral partial abduction of eyeballs.
Absent sensations over left half of face.
Very prominent slurring of speech with marked scanning of each syllable and
inability to pronounce jointed words (yuktaksharas).
Bilateral motor weakness of upper and lower limbs with lower limbs grade 3
minus and upper limb 4 minus. The right sided power is lesser than the left
side.

What is the cranial nerve finding depicted above suggestive of in terms of
anatomical localization?
If the etiology is vascular then which vessels are likely involved?
What could be the localization for his dementia? What information will help you
to localize it further? (3)

      Treatment of pseudopancreatic cyst comprises two aspects: supportive care
      or medical management and definitive care or surgical drainage.

      Intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antiemetics are the basic
      requirements

      Intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antiemetics are the basic
      requirements
      Weber's syndrome, also known as superior alternating hemiplegia, is a
      form of stroke characterized by the presence of an ipsilateral oculomotor
      nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia
      There is a multitude of etiologies that can lead to a stroke. Some of the
      most common risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
      hypercholesterolemia, physical inactivity, obesity, genetics, and
      smoking. Cerebral emboli commonly originate from the heart, especially in
      patients with preexisting heart arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation),
      valvular disease, structural defects (atrial and ventricular septal
      defects) and chronic rheumatic heart disease. Emboli may lodge in areas
      of preexisting stenosis.[3] Alcohol intake has a J-shaped relationship
      with ischemic stroke. Mild to moderate drinking carries a slightly lower
      risk of ischemic stroke yet heavier drinking increases the risk
      drastically. Alcohol intake increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in a
      near linear relationship.

      Strokes that occur in small vessels(lacunar infarcts) are most commonly
      caused by chronic, uncontrolled hypertension resulting in the
      pathological entity of lipohyalinosis and arteriolosclerosis. These
      strokes occur in the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, and pons.
      Uncontrolled hypertension in these areas can also lead to hypertensive
      intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH).[4]

      About 15% of all strokes are classified as hemorrhagic, with the etiology
      being the most commonly uncontrolled hypertension. Other causes of
      hemorrhagic strokes include cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a disease in
      which amyloid plaques deposit in small and medium vessels, which causes
      vessels to become rigid and more vulnerable to tears. Deposition can
      occur anywhere, but they occur most commonly on the surfaces of the
      frontal and parietal lobes. The structural integrity of vessels is
      another important consideration in hemorrhagic stroke etiology, with
      aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations,
      capillary telangiectasias, venous angiomas, and vasculitis being more
      common reasons for stroke.[5]

      SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)

      Cause
      SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) – virus identified in 2003. SARS-CoV is
      thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir,
      perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first
      infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002.

      Transmission
      An epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000
      cases in 2003. Since then, a small number of cases have occurred as a
      result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through animal-to-human
      transmission (Guangdong, China).

      Transmission of SARS-CoV is primarily from person to person. It appears
      to have occurred mainly during the second week of illness, which
      corresponds to the peak of virus excretion in respiratory secretions and
      stool, and when cases with severe disease start to deteriorate
      clinically. Most cases of human-to-human transmission occurred in the
      health care setting, in the absence of adequate infection control
      precautions. Implementation of appropriate infection control practices
      brought the global outbreak to an end.

      Nature of the disease
      Symptoms are influenza-like and include fever, malaise, myalgia,
      headache, diarrhoea, and shivering (rigors). No individual symptom or
      cluster of symptoms has proved to be specific for a diagnosis of SARS.
      Although fever is the most frequently reported symptom, it is sometimes
      absent on initial measurement, especially in elderly and immunosuppressed
      patients.

      Cough (initially dry), shortness of breath, and diarrhoea are present in
      the first and/or second week of illness. Severe cases often evolve
      rapidly, progressing to respiratory distress and requiring intensive
      care.

      Geographical distribution
      The distribution is based on the 2002–2003 epidemic. The disease appeared
      in November 2002 in the Guangdong province of southern China. This area
      is considered as a potential zone of re-emergence of SARS-CoV.

      Other countries/areas in which chains of human-to-human transmission
      occurred after early importation of cases were Toronto in Canada, Hong
      Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Chinese Taipei, Singapore,
      and Hanoi in Viet Nam.

      Risk for travellers
      Currently, no areas of the world are reporting transmission of SARS.
      Since the end of the global epidemic in July 2003, SARS has reappeared
      four times – three times from laboratory accidents (Singapore and Chinese
      Taipei), and once in southern China where the source of infection remains
      undetermined although there is circumstantial evidence of animal-to-human
      transmission.

      Should SARS re-emerge in epidemic form, WHO will provide guidance on the
      risk of travel to affected areas. Travellers should stay informed about
      current travel recommendations. However, even during the height of the
      2003 epidemic, the overall risk of SARS-CoV transmission to travellers
      was low.

      Prophylaxis

      None. Experimental vaccines are under development.

      Precautions
      Follow any travel recommendations and health advice issued by WHO.

      We did a trial run now with Dr Rashmita and Dr Ajit and it's possible
      that directly posting to the blog can sometimes cause errors and the
      message may not go through. So as a back up please also send it to my

      Few of you have shared your handwritten versions and while the only
      original content in them is your handwriting which we appreciate, it's
      much more easier for us to assess and share if we can get those in a
      typed version.

      I know all of you love your handwriting practice but at least once in two
      weeks you can have some typing practice too. 👍

      Thanks to those who have begun uploading your answers online and or
      shared them in email.

      Can you paste the question before your answers as otherwise it's
      difficult to sort them out and also difficult to guage which questions
      you have left out especially if you have done your own numbering (for
      example you may have used 1,2,3...for a, b, c...in the original
      question? 

      Please share the reference link when you share generic information such
      as in short notes.

      For example when you share the short note below:

      "Pancreatic pseudocyst: 

      Pancreatic pseudocysts can be described as fluid-filled cavities arising
      from the pancreas and surrounded by a wall of fibrous or inflammatory
      tissue, but lacking an epithelial cover.

      Most common after chronic pancreatitis than acute pancreatitis..." we
      realize this is text book knowledge but it would be nice to have a
      reference to the text book with page numbers along with an online link to
      it. 

      Please check below an example on how text book information is cited and
      referenced:

      "Example: Chapter in an Edited Book

      In-Text Citation (Quotation):

      (Stewart, 2007, p. 102)

      References:

      Stewart, B. (2007). Chapter title... "Pancreatic pseudocyst" In J.
      Jaimeson, T. Bannerman, & S. Wong (Eds.), Pancreatic disorders (pp. 97-
      105). Toronto, Canada: university Press." (Online link)

      The above was just an example to also make you learn to cite references
      as it will become important for you all to write papers (once you begin
      working on projects that can run parallel to your thesis). 👍

      Other than the above there can be some scope for originality too in your
      online submitted answer paper if you can add to the questions around the
      patients, add to the history and clinical findings and add more questions
      around the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties in these three
      patients.

      Lastly we are looking forward to your submitting some different patients
      with different medical issues in a similar question format that will if
      good enough become automatically be selected for the next fortnightly
      exam.

      Once we make this a regular project and publish and share it with the
      university there may be enough traction for them to adopt this
      methodology even for the finals 👍

      Assessor's inputs on the answers in general (hoping not to sound too
      patronizing):

      A large volume of copy paste that will be construed as plagiarism when
      shared online. However this is a transition phase where our students are
      learning to realize how copy pasting from memory (aka paraphrasing in
      one's own words after internalizing) is not the same as copy pasting
      directly from one online location to another although both are similar in
      some ways. We shall be able to quickly grow out of this phase I am sure
      with a little more persistence.
