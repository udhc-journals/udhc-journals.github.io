Outcomes of monitoring suspected acute and chronic glomerular injuries with
random and 24 hour urinary protein creatinine estimations along with patient
events 

PROBLEM STATEMENT / BACKGROUND 

"In most patients with evidence of glomerular disease there is no single
measure that provides a specific diagnosis, not even kidney biopsy. To achieve
a specific diagnosis, and all that this implies for appropriate management, it
is often necessary to test broadly and use a systematic approach."

Quoted from : Cravedi P, Remuzzi G. Pathophysiology of proteinuria and its
value as an outcome measure in chronic kidney disease. Br J Clin Pharmacol. 
(2013) 76:516–23. 10.1111/bcp.12104 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3791975

However in many patients the glomerular disease may progress and an important
factor that is linked to patient survival is residual renal function,
clinically assessed as the amount of daily urinary output. Many factors
conspire against this important variable: aging, the etiologies of renal
failure and time on dialysis.

Hemodialysis. In (Ed.), Hemodialysis. IntechOpen.https://doi.org/10.5772/53657

AIM :

To study outcomes of monitoring suspected acute and chronic glomerular injuries
with random and 24 hour urinary protein creatinine estimations along with
patient events.

OBJECTIVES:
• To assess various clinical and investigational characteristics of patients
with suspected glomerular injury in relation to the initial disease events in
individual patients and their outcomes.
• To analyse patient outcomes based on morbidity (physical, social &
psychological limitations)

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
PLACE OF STUDY: Department of General medicine 

STUDY PERIOD: November 2022- October 2024

STUDY DESIGN : Non experimental (Observational) qualitative Prospective Study 

SAMPLE SIZE: 50 patients 

INCLUSION CRITERIA:

• Proteinuria  patients of any gender above or equal to 18yrs of age at the
time of presentation.

• Patients presenting with a combination of proteinuria and complex etiological
events and outcomes. 
EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

1.Patients below 18 yrs of age (minors)

2.Patients not capable of giving consent (mentally-ill patients)

3.Patients not willing to participate in study (non-consenting patients) 


PROFORMA (data to be captured) 


Demographics

Patient event data reflected in a narrative history of the  sequence of events
leading to the current presentation and outcomes

Body data from clinical general and systemic examination 

Pallor 

Lymphadenpathy 

Nails 

Organomegaly

Muscle mass 

Mid arm circumference 

Visceral fat 

Body data from laboratory investigation :

    * CBP with peripheral smear 
    * Urine for cue 
    * Urine for random protein creatinine ratio 
    * Urine for 24 hour urine protein and creatinine and electrolytes where
      indicated 
    * Iron profile with serum ferritin 
    * Serum albumin 
    * Serum urea and  creatinine, RFT 
    * Special tests on indication :
    * Thyroid function tests 
    * Chest X-ray -PA view
    * ECG
    * 2D ECHO
    * Renal biopsy if indicated 
Data from treatment instituted :

Data from Patient reported outcomes :

Daily diet in the form of meal images captured before consumption 

Daily intake output
