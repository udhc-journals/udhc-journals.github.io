      InFebruary 2017, my immune system was not functioning correctly and my
      primarycare physician did a N.A.E.T. Treatment with Laser Acupuncture
      andAuricular Acupuncture to try to desensitize my body from the
      differentallergies and allergies to the metals. This procedure began to
      make me drained and very fatigued.  He recommended that I have a GI Stool
      testdone as I was having GI issues in February 2017, to check for
      parasites,pathogens, bacterial flora, and fungi/yeasts. The results
      showed that I had a Bacterial Pathogen called Salmonella,high amounts of
      normal bacterial flora, called Enterococcus spp. andEscherichia spp., 2
      parasites called Dientamoeba fragilis and Endolimax nana, and2 types of
      fungi/yeasts called Candida spp. and Geotrichum spp.   The doctor
      recommended that I take Dr Itua Herbal Medicine to get rid of the Candida
      as that was the main concern at thetime and I did purchase Dr Itua Herbal
      Medicine and after taking it all as instructed I was totally cured so is
      a urged form of heart to believe in herbal medicines but yes indeed
      natural remedies should be recognize around the globe because is the only
      healing that has no side effect on each every healing, I will recommend
      anyone here with health challenge to contact Dr Itua Herbal Center on E-
      Mail  drituaherbalcenter@gmail.com he capable of all kind of disease like
      Cancer,Hiv,Herpes,Kidney disease,Parkinson,ALS,Copd. with a complete cure
      without coming back.
