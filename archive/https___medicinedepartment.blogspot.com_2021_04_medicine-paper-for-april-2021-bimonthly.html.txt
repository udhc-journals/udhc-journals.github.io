                    Questions plan and context:
We are also utilizing this online assessment platform for a participatory
action research strategy in "Scholarship of integration in Medical education
research" as part of a commissioned book project and your online answers will
also be analyzed and interpreted with that intent. 

A brief word about the book project outline before we move into the stem of the
question paper: Scholarship of integration in medical education and research
aims to disseminate back to society the fruits of academic discovery and
translates medical education theory that developed from discoveries made by
individual academics in countless individual members of society into a practice
that again benefits the same or different individual members of society. For
more click on: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1891293/

The questions below cover the entire spectrum from medical humanities, anatomy,
physiology to diagnostic, therapeutic uncertainty and computational tools
popularly known as ML AI to resolve one disease theme and predictably move from
symptoms to diagnosis and treatment challenges. 

Most questions test the reading comprehension skills of the examinee and some
prior familiarity with medical terms and strategies and also more importantly
assesses their ability to use online search tools toward better expression of
their learning points in the form of answers that are again made available open
access for post publication peer review.

In summary the answers to the following questions in this online question paper
will assess the examinee's competencies in dealing with:

Clinical problem solving 

Medical terminologies familiarity including areas of anatomy, physiology,
pathology, ML, AI 

Empathy and medical humanities 

Current EBM strategies for managing diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty 

                    Section 1) Please go through the
                    patient data in the links below and
                    answer the following questions:

Anatomic and physiologic localization of symptomatology 

In patient's own voice:

Patient 1
"I suffered from bad cramps and loose stool movements – and not the usual
stomach cramps, it felt like someone was trying to tear out my insides.
On top of that, I was constantly bloated, suffered from bad mouth ulcers, mood
swings, hot and cold chills, weight loss, and the dreaded haemorrhoids. It was
only in the last year that I started noticing a lot of blood in my stools
(lovely I know). My whole body was in pain, from my joints to my muscles, and
to my mental state. This led to me becoming quite depressed and anxious, making
matters a whole lot worse."
Patient 2:
"I had just gotten back from a holiday with a group of my friends when I had to
leave work. I was experiencing constant fever symptoms, I fainted a few times
and I was going to the toilet about 15-20 times a day. Not only this but every
time I had to use the toilet I was losing blood"

routine-living-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-1.3368509?mode=amp
Patient 3
"2004 and early 2005 were the the darkest days of my life. With no proper
diagnosis and treatment, I was going nowhere. Every day was a challenge. I
cloud barely drink a glass of fruit juice. No question of taking solid food.
Just a bit of solid food in my mouth, it used to cause intense burning. If I
managed to forcefully swallow some food, I used to vomit immediately. I was
weighing 30kg, just skin and bones. Everyone lost hope, I was not knowing what
went wrong and on top of that, everyone who came to see me used to say " your
parents and doctors are putting all the efforts to make you healthy, but you
don't seem to put any kind of effort or show any intension to get better. Looks
like you are enjoying being sick and you want to remain sick.
They were giving me all kinds of suggestions ' why don't you eat, why don't you
get up from the bed etc etc. I felt inside ' if these people, even for a
minute, go through, the kind of pain I'm bearing for years and, manage to live
for a couple of days, I would listen to their suggestion.
Suicidal thoughts were coming, I decided to end my life, luckily my mother came
to my rescue and told me ' if you want to die, you should not die alone, I will
also end my life along with you ' she said live and fight. That day I promised
her, come what way, I'm not going to give up."

In health professional's notes:
Patient 4:

Question 1) What are the common themes emerging from these symptom narratives?
Does the symptomatology related by the patient's own voice evoke more empathy
than the one in the health professional notes? Are there studies correlating
patient empathy generated in health professionals to disease outcomes or even
the doctor patient relationship? 

Question 2) One easily appreciable theme in all these narratives is the impact
of the colonic pathology on the patient's psyche with severe symtomatologies
precipitating suicidal depression. While the influence of somatic pathology on
psyche is easy to appreciate are their studies demonstrating the influence of
psyche and life events (that are often part of symptomatology narratives) on
disease pathology manifesting in the soma? Please go through the article linked
here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1774724/ and list the
evidence for the fact that both chronic stress, in the form of adverse life
events, and acute experimental stress can affect systemic immune and
inflammatory function, and increase disease activity in humans with IBD.

Diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties 
Diagnostic uncertainty:
Patient 3:
"I spent first 10 years of my life absolutely healthy. Started becoming sick
after that. Saw few local doctors both allopathy/homeopathy, they said
everything was fine, but I wasn't improving. Later met one of the leading
gastroenterologist at ABCD Institute of Gastroenterology who diagnosed me as
having TB in March 2001 and put on Anti Tuberculosis Treatment for 3 years that
ended in march 2004.
After 3 years of pain and suffering, I went from bad to worse. The doctor said
' why did you come again, your treatment is over'.  I asked doctor the reason
for not recovering he said ' it might not be TB, it might be some other
disease, get admitted we will evaluate again'.
I could not digest those words, I was seeing him every fifteen days for 3 years
with all the tests and reports.
2004 and early 2005 were the the darkest days of my life. With no proper
diagnosis and treatment, I was going nowhere. Every day was a challenge."
Above quoted from:
https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/04/empathic-narrative-in-
inflammatory.html?m=1
Patient 4:
In this patient logged by our Intern here  http://sruthi995.blogspot.com/2021/
04/is-online-e-log-book-to-discuss-our.html there was a debate among the health
professional team managing him around what if they were missing a tuberculosis
of the colon? What if the previous colonoscopy and biopsy had missed the
diagnosis of tuberculosis especially as it hadn't been done by a
Gastroenterologist but by a general surgeon? While a repeat colonoscopy and
biopsy was planned again the expenses were too much to bear for the family
members who left after promising to try getting the colonoscopy at a cheaper
price from elsewhere and return to us for follow up. 
Therapeutic uncertainty:
Patient 1:
"I was taking several different medications at a time for over four months, but
the worst of them all was the steroid called prednisone (anyone who has been on
these can sympathise with me). These are truly the worst steroids in the world,
I gained so much weight, I suffered from moon face, which made me look like a
chipmunk (and not a cute one). I started receiving Infliximab (Remicade)
infusions every two months, which is an auto-immune suppressant drug used to
treat IBD."
Patient 2:
"I thought I could get it under control quickly and everything would go back to
the way it was. I was wrong. The first six months after diagnosis were hell on
earth. I developed severe anxiety about leaving the house as a result of my
illness and symptoms. I tried to return to work and then became depressed when
I failed miserably. My relationship ended. I had no appetite and couldn’t put
back on the weight which resulted in me feeling really badly about my body and
appearance.
I was taking steroids called Prednisone for the first three months and they
made my face swell up, my hair fall out and also added massively to the anxiety
and depression I was already dealing with. I began getting Infliximab
(Remicade) infusions to suppress my immune system every eight weeks. That
eventually had to be changed to every six weeks because my symptoms were still
quite severe and the medication wasn’t lasting long enough.
Fourteen months down the line after diagnosis I am still struggling. "
Quoted above from: www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/my-daily-
routine-living-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-1.3368509?mode=amp

Question 3) What are the current computational advances to resolve diagnostic
uncertainty for health professionals such as the one described in patient 4? Go
through this article: https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/
10.1186/s12911-020-01277-w and list the differences in the endoscopy findings
between ulcerative colitis and intestinal tuberculosis identified by the Random
forest and CNN model. Go through the colonoscopic descriptions captured in the
patient 4 online EMR linked above and share your insights on what could be the
probable diagnosis. Please share your current general knowledge thoughts or
similar past experiences in diagnostic uncertainty while dealing with patients
with potential inflammatory bowel disease and how you resolved them. 

Question 4)

List the current therapeutic strategies for IBD and share your critical
appraisal of a few RCTs around each option, not only those mentioned in the
patient narratives above such as SAIDs like prednisolone and biologicals like
infliximab but also NSAIDs such as meselamine and immunomodulators such as
azathioprine. 

Advocacy and pluralistic integration of available solutions as a therapeutic
tool.

Patient 3:

 "I tried Allopathy, Ayurveda, Naturopathy, etc. They helped me to some extent,
they helped to be alive, but not helped me to the extent I wanted. Then I
thought let me try YOGA."

Quoted from here:

https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/04/empathic-narrative-in-
inflammatory.html?m=1
 
Patient 5:

"You see, it’s really difficult to live with Crohn’s or ulcerative_colitis as
it is but in many cultures around the world, there is little to no acceptance
of young people who have chronic illnesses. And even though I live in
cosmopolitan New York City, I have had one foot in two cultures: the country of
my origin, India, and the country of my birth, the United States. According to
South Asian culture, I was supposed to be taking care of my widowed mother, not
being a burden on her. I was supposed to be out working my Wall Street job and
supporting my family, not being a frequent flyer on the IBD floor of my
hospital. As the oldest child of the family with no father and no brothers, my
role was to take care of my family, not be the person being constantly taken
care of."

Question 5) What is the role of the internet and it's patient users toward
driving their own healthcare outcomes through timely sharing of their problems
and pluralistic solution inputs from patient advocates and health
professionals? What is the role of a doctor patient relationship in healing
outcomes as demonstrated in some of the narratives? Please share your own
experiences where you were part of one such relationship that worked positively
or negatively for your patient. What is the role of computational ML AI in
considerably expanding this "user driven healthcare" space? Please search for
clinical decision support projects that begin with "applications that assign
SNOMED CT codes to entered patient data which in turn trigger decision support
information." 

Check out how these can be further expanded using ML AI techniques to create
knowledge graphs toward 

"1) Named-Entity Recognition — given a patient’s initial complaint, the NER
should tag medical and clinical entities.
2) Classification — e.g. classify an initial patient chat as an informational
session or requires a visit to a hospital.
3) Diagnosis — ability to provide a diagnosis (with certain probability) given
a chat session

management-part-i-42e00f49301c

Finally to sign out on a note around the disease theme in this question paper,
from your own user perspective, please critically appraise this paper that
develops an "ontology encapsulating IBD physicians knowledge
and describes different characteristics such as classification, medi-
cation, the activity of the disease, diagnosis techniques and various
other IBD attributes along with generating a knowledge graph by
importing 560 patient records collected in their University Hospital
ontology."
