The formative assessment has been divided into non-verbal which assesses their
competency in procedural domains including empathic communication and body
language and verbal which assesses their ability to communicate their work
through their day to day E logs.


Most students have done reasonably in the formative assessment in both verbal
and non verbal communication domains although a lot remains to be improved on. 


Most students haven't done well at all in the summative assessment and many
have not only plagiarised blatantly from articles on the internet (inspite of
express instructions on how not to resort to that) but also copy pasted from
each other's log books. Some of the top UG students have predictably done well
on all fronts including avoidance of plagiarism.
