Feel free to be creative and not necessarily be restricted by the above format.
Please be original and refrain from plagiarism. Please note that every logged
answer paper should contain the link to this current "assignment/question
paper" page and the patient context for each answer. Also share the detailed
online links to every quote or reference cited in your answer. 
                    Questions plan and context:
All questions are around student driven patient centered case reports prepared
by our students (including 2019 batch students in 3rd semester) over last one
month. For the same students taking this exam, separate marks will be provided
for their contribution to the questions. 

We are also utilizing this online assessment platform for a participatory
action research strategy in "developing student driven patient centered
research projects and your online answers will be analyzed and interpreted with
that intent for example in the May assignment link here: https://
medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/05/?m=0
the question around covid is linked to our ongoing covid project and the
question around heart failure is linked to our heart failure project detailed
here: https://vamsikrishna1996.blogspot.com/2020/10/thesis.html

As noted in the May assignment link, the questions cover the entire spectrum
from anatomy, physiology to diagnostic, therapeutic uncertainty to resolve one
disease theme and predictably move from symptoms to diagnosis and treatment
challenges. 

Most questions in the April and May assessments, test the reading comprehension
skills of the examinee and some prior familiarity with medical terms and
strategies and also more importantly assesses their ability to use online
search tools toward better expression of their learning points in the form of
answers that are again made available open access for post publication peer
review.

In summary the answers to the questions in the prior online question papers
assess the examinee's competencies in empathically dealing with:

Clinical problem solving 

Medical terminologies familiarity including areas of anatomy, physiology,
pathology 

Current EBM strategies for managing diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty 

While the April 2021 assignment linked here :
https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/04/medicine-paper-for-april-2021-
bimonthly.html?m=0
was themed around a single disease, inflammatory bowel disease IBD, the May
2021 assignment was themed around multiple organ systems to encourage and
enable examinees to make connections between various organ systems. 

The theme for this question paper is "scholarship of integration in medical
education and research"  which is a tool to facilitate connections between
different systems or disciplines of "knowledge" or learning in healthcare (in
the context of medical education and research). 

In keeping with the above theme, in this assignment we shall evaluate the
examinees aptitude for 

a) scholarship, which is reflected in their ability to read comprehend,
analyze, reflect upon and discuss captured patient centered data as in their
'original' answers to the assignment for May 2021. 

b) scholarship of integration, which is reflected in 

1) their ability to connect with and capture patient centered data (as already
demonstrated by many of the 2019, 2017, 2016 batch students who have captured
it in their E logs as a part of their formative assessment) 

2) their ability to connect with and engage in shared learning with their peers
through peer review feedback. 

Question 1: Competency tested for Peer to peer review and assessment : 

Please go through one particular answer of ten students in this link:
https://generalmedicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/06/bimonthly-formative-and-
summative_19.html?m=1
and share your peer review of each answer with your quantitative marking input
as well as qualitative insights into what was good or bad about the answer. 

Question 2-4: 

Patient centered data 
captured by students from 2016 batch in the link below:

Q2) Share the link to your own case report of a patient that you connected with
and engaged while capturing his her sequential life events before and after the
illness and clinical and investigational images along with your discussion of
that case. 

Q3) (Testing peer review competency of the examinees) :

Please go through the cases in the links shared above and provide your critical
appraisal of the captured data in terms of completeness, correctness and
ability to provide useful leads to analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic
uncertainties around the cases shared.

Q4: Testing scholarship competency of the examinees ( ability to read
comprehend, analyze, reflect upon and discuss captured patient centered data as
in their 'original' answers to the assignment for May 2021):

Please analyze the above linked patient data by first preparing a problem list
for each patient (based on the shared data) and then discuss the diagnostic and
therapeutic uncertainty around solving those problems. Also include the review
of literature around sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic
interventions mentioned and same around efficacy of the therapeutic
interventions mentioned for each patient. 

Q 5) Testing scholarship competency in  
logging reflective observations on your concrete experiences of this last month
: (10 marks) 

Reflective logging  of one's own experiences is a vital tool toward competency
development in medical education and research. 

A sample answer to this last assignment around sharing your experience log of
the month can be seen in one student's  answer to Q10 in the  May 2021
assignment in the link below:

https://drsaranyaroshni.blogspot.com/2021/05/assignment-patient-centred-
learning.html?m=1

Please reflect on and share  your telemedical learning experiences from the
 hospital as well as community  patients over the last month particularly while
you were E logging their case report while even in the hospital or perhaps when
locked down at home.
