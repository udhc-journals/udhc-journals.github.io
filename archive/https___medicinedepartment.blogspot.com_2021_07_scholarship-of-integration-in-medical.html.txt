"Scholarship of integration in medical education and research aims to
disseminate back to society the fruits of academic discovery and translates
medical education theory that developed from discoveries made by individual
academics in countless individual members of society into a practice that again
benefits the same or different individual members of society. For more click

In this presentation we shall share how a group of medical students and their
teachers spread out globally as well as across India have utilized the tool of
"scholarly integration" to develop global health learning outcomes online
toward solving global health care problems in their local context offline here:
