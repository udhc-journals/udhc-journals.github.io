**** Abstract for book chapter on "Scholarship of Integration and the future of
Medical education and research" ****
Abstract :

Scholarship of integration in medical education and research makes connections
within and between disciplines, locating knowledge in a broader context giving
meaning to specific discoveries. It aims to distribute the fruits of academic
discovery to benefit specific individual members of society aka patients who in
turn help academics to multiply the construction of new knowledge translated
into practice. (Reference:
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1891293/#!po=75.3968)

The fruits of academic discovery by individual academics, students, their
teacher learners and end beneficiaries of their education (patients), are
stored in open access, online learning portfolios with optimal transparency and
accountability toward development of further knowledge based, user driven,
impactful learning and research in medical education and practice. 

This chapter contextualizes and describes a working prototype for scholarly
integration in medical education and research framework showcasing student user
driven, patient centered assessments of learning outcomes driving health care
outcomes. This is a postulated effective tool to tackle the problem statement
highlighted in the chapter primarily around two broad categories and it's
subcategories:

a) Current disintegration of Medical education and practice 

Medical student and faculty engagement in rote memorization through an arcane
curriculum that promotes plagiarism and diminishes scholarship 

disconnected from 

Patients who continue to suffer due to lack of student and faculty engagement
with them in a broader empathic meaningful manner. 

b) Long overdue National Medical integration of health care delivery through
methodologically diverse streams of interventions:

India's traditional and tribal system of Medicine historically neglected due to
undue hype created by a dominant Western mode of Medical education that engages
our students and teachers as unquestioning slaves.

Although current West has moved on globally, we are unable to get over our
colonial past that continues to haunt our education and practice. 

The working prototype described in this chapter tackles the above problem
statements head on and describes a participatory action research framework and
learning ecosystem that thrives in transparency, accountability and real time
evidence based audit of education and practice.
