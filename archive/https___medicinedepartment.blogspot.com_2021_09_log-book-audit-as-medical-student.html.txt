**** Log Book audit as a medical student assessment strategy ****
 
***** The individual students in each annual batch is evaluated under 
 *****

***** three headings : *****

1) Presence (offline and online availability and prompt response to text
message) 

2) Learning competencies attained 

3) Impact on the learning ecosystem and patient outcomes 

****** Results of the students are divided into  ******

three groups: 

Average, negative and positive Outliers :


Average : scored 5/10

 
***** Negative Outliers-- *****

Scored less than 5/10 - few students who have  

less than desired presence, 

Below average competencies in areas of 

knowledge, 

patient data capture in terms of life events and Clinical findings 

and 

inabilty toward clinical data analysis to arrive at a diagnosis and treatment
plan after raising relevant pedagogic questions to ascertain the patient
requirements and their own learning requirements 

also 

negatively influencing other group members toward avoidance of patients as well
as  learning sessions. 

Positive Outliers--

Scored more than 7/10:

Regular punctual presence and proper efforts toward patient data collection and
analysis, not only to satisfy their own learning competencies but also help
improve others learning outcomes by sharing their queries in local as well as
global groups, kindling the discussion to enable all the members to learn from
it as well as put positive efforts toward organizing diagnosis and treatment
strategies to improve patient outcomes (for example encourage blood and organ
donors and organize resources for necessary investigations or treatment). 

Log all the above daily in their blogged online learning portfolios with links
to their local and global learning activity.

Our log book evaluation assessment is concordant with the NMC log book
