Problem statement/background :


"Understanding anemia’s varied and complex etiology is crucial for developing
effective interventions that address the context-specific causes of anemia." 

"While iron deficiency ID remains a primary cause in many settings, the
proportion of anemic individuals with ID varies by contextual factors, and poor
iron nutrition cannot be assumed to be the primary cause in all cases.Given the
complex etiology of anemia, the extent to which ID accounts for the anemia
burden continues to be investigated."

AIM: 

To navigate clinical complexity in patients with anemia and optimize their
management toward reducing diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty along with
improvement in their anemia outcomes. 

OBJECTIVES:
• To assess various clinical and investigational characteristics of patients
with anemia in relation to their clinical complexity and outcomes.
• To analyse patient outcomes based on morbidity (physical, social &
psychological limitations)
PATIENTS AND METHODS:
PLACE OF STUDY: Department of General medicine 

STUDY PERIOD: November 2022- October 2024

STUDY DESIGN : Non experimental (Observational) qualitative Prospective Study 

SAMPLE SIZE: 50 patients 

INCLUSION CRITERIA:

• Anemia patients of any gender above or equal to 18yrs of age at the time of
presentation.

• Patients presenting with a combination of anemia and complex etiological
possibilities where the diagnosis remains uncertain and treatment remains
empirical. 

For example a typical patient to be included may  have low hemoglobin and low
serum ferritin with no history of blood loss or dietary indiscretions or a
patient with low hemoglobin and high serum ferritin likely to have both iron
deficiency as well as chronic inflammation. 


EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

1.Patients below 18 yrs of age (minors)

2.Patients not capable of giving consent (mentally-ill patients)

3.Patients not willing to participate in study (non-consenting patients) 


PROFORMA (data to be captured) 


Demographics

Patient event data reflected in a narrative history of the  sequence of events
leading to the current presentation and outcomes

Body data from clinical general and systemic examination 

Pallor 

Lymphadenpathy 

Nails 

Organomegaly 

Skin 

Muscle mass 

Mid arm circumference 

Visceral fat 

Body data from laboratory investigation :

    * CBP with peripheral smear 
    * Iron profile with serum ferritin 
    * Serum albumin 
    * Serum creatinine
    * Special tests on indication :
    * Thyroid function tests 
    * Chest X-ray -PA view
    * ECG
    * 2D ECHO
    * Bone marrow if indicated 
Data from treatment instituted :

Data from Patient reported outcomes :

Daily functionality (in terms of routine activities)

Daily diet in the form of meal images captured before consumption 

Daily intake output where relevant such as complex anemias with renal failure
and nutritional deficiency or anemia and chronic diarrhoea

and doubtful dietary indiscretions, treated empirically with iv iron)

bone pains presumably due to an acute sickle cell crisis?)

discuss.html?m=1 (Anemia of chronic inflammation due to multiple chronic
perineal abscesses and or iron deficiency?)

hyponatremia.html?m=1 (Sepsis, hyponatremia and anemia) 

Clinical complexity consists of a few defining characteristics such as
uncertainty, non linearity, unpredictability and yet an overall pattern leading
to resolution through attractor states over time. (2) As physician attractors
we are uniquely privileged to "be" with our patients regardless of the
diagnosis and that is the only way we may know our patient's outcomes where our
"being" with them is the most significant (and often overlooked) intervention.
