divisions, roll 1-24 from morning 11AM-1:00 PM and roll 26-48 afternoon 2-4 PM
batches for clinical patient centered learning to the department of Medicine.Â

summative_19.html?m=0
Â 
The individual students in the current batch was evaluated under three headings
:
Â 
1) Physical presenceÂ 
2) Learning competencies attainedÂ 
3) Impact on the learning ecosystem and patient outcomesÂ 
Â 
Results of the students are divided into three groups: Average and negative and
positive Outliers :
Â 
Average: scored 5/10
Negative Outliers--
Scored less than 5/10 - few students who had:Â 
less than 50% physical presence,Â 
Below average competencies in areas ofÂ knowledge,Â patient data capture in terms
of life events and Clinical findingsÂ andÂ inabilty toward clinical data analysis
to arrive at a diagnosis and treatment plan after raising relevant pedagogic
questions to ascertain the patient requirements and their own learning
requirementsÂ alsoÂ negatively influencing other group members toward avoidance
of patients and to escape the learning sessions.Â Positive Outliers--Scored more
than 5/10:Regular punctual physical presence and proper efforts toward patient
data collection and analysis not only to satisfy their own learning
competencies but also help improve others learning outcomes by sharing their
queries in the group kindling the discussion to enable all the members to learn
from it as well as put positive efforts toward organizing diagnosis and
treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes (for example encourage blood
and organ donors and raise resoureces for necessary investigations or
treatment).Â
