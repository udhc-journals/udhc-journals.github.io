MR+,trivial AR+,dilated all chambers ,global hypokinesia,severe LV
dysfunction,mild PAHT,no MS/AS,no PE/LV clot

DIAGNOSIS:
                heart failure with reduced ejection fraction secondary to viral
myocarditis with denovo DM type 2

TREATMENT:
Tab.lasix 80mg...40mg...40mg
Tab.isosorbide mononitrate10mg bd
Tab.hydralazine 25mg
Tab. Telma20mg
Tab.metformin 500mg po od
Fluid restriction <1litre/day
Salt restriction <2gms/day

On_14/05/2020:
Patient came for opd with complaints of pedal odema and shortness of breath 
since 1week 
Patient is investigated for 2d echo and findings are: left ventricular
dilatation ,left atrial dilatation,end point septal separation distance is
increased,right atrial and ventricular dilatation ,global hypokinesia.
Based on the above findings we have increased the dosage of vymarda 50mg BD 
(sacubitril 26mg +valsartan24mg) to vymarda to 100 mg BD.

He_have_been_asked_to_revisit_after_1_month_for_check_up.

PROCEDURE:
Today I have seen 2d echo which is done by our Pg mam for a congestive cardiac
failure patient where we can see mitral valve is not able to touch
interventricular septum which clearly explains improper functioning of heart
with reduced stroke volume and with left ventricular hypertrophy. 

Here is the video of 2d echo:

Here is the comparison between systolic and diastolic images of heart helps in
knowing ejaculatory fraction

      History updated today by Dr Aashita PGY2 below:


      35 year old man working as a food caterer from
      presented to our OPD with the complains of :
      Dyspnea since 5 days
      Cough since 5 days
      Bilateral pedal edema since 4 days
      Followed by
      abdominal distension since 3 days
      Patient was born and brought up in xxxx . He was born to a farmer and a
      housewife and has 2 siblings, an elder sister who is a houswife and has
      been married to an advocate and an elder brother who is a software
      engineer. He has completed his degree in electronics and has been working
      as a food caterer in xxxx the last 10 years. In these last 10 years he
      has been regularly consuming alcohol around 180 ml of whiskey everyday
      along with his other friends. He says he used to sometimes feel lonely
      and he decided not to get married unless the financial situation of his
      family settles.

      He was apparently completely alright until December 2019 when he
      developed dyspnea which was sudden in onset and was associated with
      occasional cough on and off and was also associated with bilateral pedal
      edema and abdominal distension. He says his dyspnea used to aggravate on
      exertion and it wasnt associated with chest pain, palpitations,
      hemoptysis or reduced urine output. Though he tells it used to aggravate
      on laying position.

      He was taken to a hospital in xxxx where they put on some unknown
      medications for 10 days. He visited our hospital as his symptoms didn't
      relieve with those medications.
      He was admitted in our hospital for few days and was diagnosed with dcmp
      with an ejection fraction of 36 %. His HbA1c was found to be 8.4 and was
      diagnosed as type 2 DM and the patient was started on OHAs and was
      stopped on OHAs after 3 days. He was advised to get an angiogram done.
      He visited NIMs hospital where CAG was done and was reported as normal.
      He was started on Ecosprin, Tab Vymada ( valsartan and sacubitril), Dytor
      plus 10/20. He stopped taking ecosprin after 2 months and was advised to
      even take oral form of Lasix 40mg twice a day on regular visits to our
      hospital.
      He now presented to us, dyspneic with a respiratory rate of 27 cpm and
      tells us he has been dyspneic the last 5 days which aggravated especially
      on climbing stairs and on laying on the bed associated with occasional
      cough with scanty mucoid non blood tinged sputum. In the past 4 days he
      has even developed bilateral pedal edema followed by abdominal
      distension.
