Preliminary draft synopsis plan 

Managing sarcopenia and visceral fat driven vascular outcomes in patients with
diabetes 

Problem statement/Background:

"Although obesity-related type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and sarcopenia have
been increasing worldwide, the associations among visceral fat accumulation,
skeletal muscle indices (mass, strength, and quality) and vascular outcomes in
T2DM remain poorly investigated."
Quoted from reference 1 : https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/
s12933-018-0755-3
Even while it's easy to qualitatively spot individuals with reduced limb muscle
mass and trunkal fat it is important to establish that improving limb muscle
mass and reducing trunkal fat utilizing diet and exercise strategies would
improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus. 
AIM:
To improve vascular outcomes in patients at risk of diabetes evidenced by their
increased visceral fat and reduced muscle mass and strength  
OBJECTIVES:
• To assess various clinical and investigational characteristics of patients
with Sarcopenia and diabetes in relation to their outcomes.
• To analyse patient outcomes based on morbidity (physical, social &
psychological limitations) & mortality.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
PLACE OF STUDY: Department of General medicine 

STUDY PERIOD: November 2022- October 2024

STUDY DESIGN : Non experimental (Observational) qualitative Prospective Study 

SAMPLE SIZE: 50 patients 

INCLUSION CRITERIA:

• Patients of any gender above or equal to 18yrs of age at the time of
presentation.

• Patients presenting with a combination of sarcopenia and increased visceral
fat with or without diabetes mellitus 


EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

1.Patients below 18 yrs of age (minors)

2.Patients not capable of giving consent (mentally-ill patients)

3.Patients not willing to participate in study (non-consenting patients)

PROFORMA (data to be captured) 

Demographics

Anthropometric indicators of sarcopenia and increased visceral fat :

Mid arm circumference 

Abdominal circumference 

Functional indices :

Hand grip 

Biceps power 

On investigation :
    * FBS, PPBS, Hba1c
    * Chest X-ray -PA view
    * ECG
    * 2D ECHO
    * CBP
    * Serum creatinine 
Patient reported outcomes :

Daily exercise (in terms of routine activities)

Daily diet in the form of meal images captured before consumption 

Blood sugar outcomes in terms of weekly FBS ppbs and Hba1c every three months

Vascular outcomes suggested by symptoms and signs of vascular events involving
different organ systems supplied by macro and micro vessels such as cardiac,
neurological, renal, ocular, cutaneous etc.
