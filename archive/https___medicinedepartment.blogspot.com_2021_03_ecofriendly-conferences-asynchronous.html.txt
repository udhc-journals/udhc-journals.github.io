Inputs from MBBS student Aadipta Ghosh:

Cyclic mastalgia is caused due to fibrocytic changes. As mentioned in the
mammograms it may be fibroadenoma. One needs to find out the causes of non
cyclic mastitis here in this patient. 

Response from expert faculty, Dr Swagata Brahmachari:

It is not mastitis as per me it is mastalgia

Query from Medicine department host:

Is there anything in the imaging that needs or can be studied pathologically
after a biopsy? What would you do for her pain that appears to be unbearable to
her?

Inputs from MBBS student Avinash Gupta:

yes sir, squamous papilloma in histopathology report

opioids like tramadol for pain relief if unbearable as its due to papilloma

Cyclic Pain - The pain is usually most severe before a menstrual period and is
often relieved when a period ends. Cyclic breast pain occurs more often in
younger women. Most cyclic pain goes away without treatment and usually
disappears at menopause.    Danazol and tamoxifen citrate are prescription
medicines used for the treatment of severe cyclic breast pain.   http://

discharges,ruptured cysts and any palpable masses if present Rakesh Biswas sir

I have used Ormeloxifene (Sevista or Novex 30mg) in pts of mastalgia and small
fibroadenoma (<2cm) with very good results clinically and radiologically

Response from host:

Any clinical trials that may have looked at the efficacy of ormeloxifene
Swagata?

Response from expert faculty:

Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol. 2015; 4(4): 1057-1060doi: 10.18203/

breast disease

Further addition from Dr Swagata:

This pts main problem is noncyclical mastalgia  which was cyclical
previously.Breast imaging is Birads 3 in  which regular monitoring is must
Hence treatment should be symptomatic. Vulval pathology is not related to
symptoms as it is most probably viral in origin (HPV) and also needs regular
radiological screening

Response from host RB:


We reviewed this patient in the OPD and the mastalgia appeared to be part of a
generalized problem of myalgia (or fibromyalgia if you will). There are many
psychological issues that require addressing in this patient Debasish, Amy
