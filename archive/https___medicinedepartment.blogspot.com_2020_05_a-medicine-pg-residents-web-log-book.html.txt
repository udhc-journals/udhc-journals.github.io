**** A medicine PG resident's Web log book ****
Hello all. I am a resident in Medicine and my daily schedule for the week is
detailed here:Â https://docs.google.com/document/d/
1lCU31w0ir_MBsJpLTFdyD9Dt1elAq9nDuwu0hfbcZ6k/
edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=106211649452385508461

This E log book is a mandatory requirement to assess our daily attendance in
terms of our mental presence and our daily learning achievements in the
medicine department where every PG Resident Â here shall by 8:00 PM (unless it's
an admission day) provide a brief log of what they have done cognitively as
well as hands on for that day from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

I have been told that the daily log can be done here under the following
headingsÂ 

1) Case based learningÂ 

a) Inpatient
b) OutpatientÂ 
c) ICUÂ 

2) ThesisÂ 

a) That day's thesis case dataÂ 
b) Questions around cases or even study design etcÂ 

3) Theory knowledge acquisition for end term summative assessment:

Paper I: Basic Medical SciencesÂ 

Paper II: Medicine and allied specialties including pediatrics, dermatology &
Â psychiatry

Paper III: Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases

Paper IV: Recent Advances in Medicine

4) Procedures done with video evidence (with patient deidentied)

The E log book or web log book is a formative assessment tool aka internal
assessment in India and in India the internal assessment as well as performance
in the final exams depends on the HOD's regular formative assessment of the
candidate's daily performance that builds up over the three years and this
internal assessment is never expressed in the form of any number but in the
form of a very very vital role the HOD plays in the candidate's learning
journey and it's completion at the end of three years.Â 

For those not logging their daily learning activities here, the impression
conveyed would be that they are not having any daily learning activity worth
sharing.

          So here goes my log of daily activities starting from:

          Monday:

          Went early for the morning rounds and found that my junior
          intern had still not arrived and that really made me mad as
          it meant that now I would have to collect all the patient
          reports by myself. ðŸ˜¡

          My senior PG admitted this young boy with a chronic gluteal
          abscess yesterday who had developed both lower limb
          weakness since five days.

          Case report:

INJ.PANTOP 40mg IV ODÂ 
BP ,PULSE MONITORING
INJ.AUGMENTIN 1.2g IV BD
OINT.MEGAHEAL FOR LOCAL APPLICATION
SITZ BATH WITH BETADINE TID
FREQUENT CHANGE OF POSITION

I saw the above treatment penned by my senior in upper case and wondered out
aloud as to why every patient who gets admitted is prescribed mandatory
pantoprazole and this one had vomiting 5 days back!! This comment was frowned
upon needless to say.Â 

Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
Â  Â In the afternoon my senior presented this patient and we had an extensive
discussion as to the etiology that you can see in the recorded video hereÂ 
https://youtu.be/ClopCj2KwZc
Â Â 

          Procedure:

          My senior PG medicine asked me to take this patient with
          severe anemia (web logged by our medical student here:
          https://classworkdecjan.blogspot.com/2016/12/60f-with-coma-
          e-coli-sepsis-and-upper.html?m=1) to the pathology
          department for a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Here is
          a video of that biopsy procedure:Â https://youtu.be/
          MeozrO1Nkyk


Theory preparation:

          In the afternoon session the same day we also had a few
          topic discussions that I reviewed again for my theory
          preparation. Check out the videos hereÂ https://
          m.youtube.com/
          watch?v=yhXqgGpfIEo&list=PLvOgc9_v4PCKsIrVK4laA3_rUJOMPAYKJ

          One such topic (check out the specific video here:https://
          www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzVI1XZ3nAI&feature=youtu.be)

          was about pheochromocytoma where I learned about why in
          preoperative management of pheochromocytomas, alpha
          blockers are given prior to beta blockers.

          "At low concentrations, adrenaline acts on beta2 receptors
          causing vasodilatation.
          At higher concentration it acts on alpha 1 receptors
          causing vasoconstriction.

          If beta blockers are given first, they act upon beta2
          receptors, thus blocking them and an unapposed alpha
          adrenergic activity can be seen which results in
          HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS and cardiovascular collapse sir.

          To prevent this non selective alpha blockers are given
          first to reduce the hypertension.

          Non selective alpha blockers cause reflex tachycardia. In
          order to further reduce the blood pressure and to reduce
          the risk of tachyarrhythmias, beta blockers are added
          further."

Also, Labetalol(alpha plus beta blocker) has a 1:7 alpha-beta blocking activity
and when it is given to a patient with pheochromocytoma, due to more beta
blocking action it results in hypertensive crisis again.

So labetalol is also not given.
I read more about it hereÂ https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/92/11/4069/
2597882

Thesis project:




At the end of the day one of my batchmates from another unit mentioned that one
patient has arrived at the causalty who looks like my thesis case and I am
currently working on a thesis on "Etiology ,Management and outcome in patients
with hyponatremia" and I have been separately logging all my thesis cases
hereÂ http://allabouthyponatremia.blogspot.com/?m=1


          Here is the detailed MCI guideline based rationale for our
          daily rosterÂ
