**** Scholarship of integration driven by shared Online learning portfolios
promoting formative, 'reading comprehension and creative writing' scholastic
competencies ****
We are able to get 200 students in each MBBS batch to share similar data
captured in their online learning portfolios as in the link here :

driven.html?m=1


This form of online portfolio based formative assessment of competency can be
improved upon and rapidly scaled to all medical colleges in India. 

The assessment framework represented by the two monthly question papers linked
here :

centred.html?m=1

, is not a part of the university summative assessment but goes to build the
formative assessment portfolio of each student and it's a given fact that
internal examiners routinely rely heavily on the longitudinal formative
assessment achievements of their students to weigh in on their summative
assessment marks and the external examiner gets the cross sectional summative
overview of that one day of the student's performance during the university
finals.
