Hi this is intern posted in General Medicine department and one of the
important terms of getting the internship completion is to complete my log book
with my daily log of what I learn during the course of my duties.

consanguinous marriage to a Civil engineer and housewife. He was born and
brought up in  Coimbatore. He has 2 younger sisters, the elder one is in her
btech final year and the younger one is in her btech first year. He finished

4th day. He again started having vomitings from the 5th day after which he went
back to the same practitioner who gave him a tablet which relieved his
vomitings for the day. The next morning on day 6, he continued having around 8-
9 episodes of vomitings after which he went to Laxmi hospital in Nalgonda where
he was put on IV fluids.

      Hi Rakesh,

      Good blog.

      There are a few discrepancies in the history where you say that the
      patient has not been able to consume anything because it is leading to
      vomiting and yet in his personal history, you say his appetite is intact.
      So does that mean an intact appetite with inability to consume or a
      complete loss of appetite.

      The attendant says that the patient appeared to lose weight and yet down
      below you mentioned that there was no complaint of weight loss.

      Also the PR on manual count was 88 and the ECG is showing a HR of 100. It
      is significant and needs to be clarified.

      What would your pivot point be in this case ? The Anemia or the subacute
      vomiting ?

            It's also extremely unusual for a patient with 10 episodes of
            vomiting per day to not have any signs of dehydration, electrolyte
            abnormalities or AKI. The history needs to be taken again I guess.

            Osmotic fragility test ? For Hereditary Spherocytosis? What is the
            pretest probability of it being positive ? No splenomegaly either.

I am an intern in medicine department and one of the important terms of getting
the internship completion is to complete my log book with my daily log of what
I learn during the course of my duties.  CASE: A 65 year old man presented to
the ER with a chief complaint of weakness in both his lower limbs since 15
days.  Detailed History The youngest of 2 and timid and shy as a boy, he quit
school at an early age in 7th standard and pursued farming and other hard
labor, following his father's footsteps. His early work involved shepherding,
breaking stones and lifting heavy weights. He was renowned for his prowess in
his locality. Married at the age of 20, he has 3 children with two daughters
and a son (attendant). A few years after his marriage, into his early 30s, the
patient first reported exertional, pounding palpitations associated with a
heaviness in his chest. He remembers that this subsided when he took rest for a
while. At this point he did not have any dyspnea, cough, chest pa

shared after taking his/her/guardian's signed informed consent.  Here we
discuss our individual patient's problems through series of inputs from
