**** CBBLE 2 and an introduction to its information granularity ****
 

Just to share an example from our regular workflow, "information granularity"
in the medical curriculum may be also guaged by online assessment links where
if you click on this link here below: https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/
2020/11/blended-bimonthly-assessment-oct-nov.html?m=0, you may find links to
both formative and summative assessment of each individual student, intern and
PGs of different years. 

Once you open those links you will find links to the log books of each student
that can show the details of each patient they have cared and learned from as a
part of a formative assessment of their verbal competency and you will also
find links to their offline presentations in the form of online videos as a
reflection of their subjective non verbal competency that can be guaged from
their body language. 

In our medical education workflow, information granularity appears to begin
with the student's online learning portfolio reflecting students learning
outcomes and continues (unendingly as learning is a never ending stream) with
the patient's healthcare outcomes as the primary beneficiary of Medical
education is the patient? 

And then once we dig deeper into the patient's report there are different
layers of information granularity about the patient beginning in the macroworld
captured by our senses and standard current radio imaging as well those in the
microworld of the patient's cells captured through the microscope and the
molecular world captured in biochemical tests. 

More here in the link below on the origins of CBBLE2 and I quote:

"Slowly the realization dawned that individual case based experiences were
different from the average data being  represented in Clinical trials where
each of these individuals was just a number.

2002: Contrary to what trial data projected, every individual was unique and
had unique life trajectories and it was found that medical students were best
suited to unearthing these trajectories as documented here: https://
www.eubios.info/EJ124/ej124j.htm

Some of these medical students who were now academic faculty, revisited this
idea in the last CBBLE paper here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC6163835/


2007: It was gradually becoming clearer that current evidence based medicine
needed a more meaningful methodology to answer individual patient requirements
here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17683292/

2008: And soon the first conceptual model for current CBBLE was shared here:
 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19018905

It was called "user driven healthcare" UDHC and described a prevalent
phenomenon evolving with the internet and the only difference with the later
CBBLE appears to be that the term "blended learning" got added to the same
process suggesting that the CBBLE had a strong component of offline connection
and locality that was blended to requirements of online users. 

The CBBLE idea as a subset of the UDHC phenomenon was to build a Case based
reasoning database that could offer any individual patient data a platform for
obtaining comparisons between other individual patients who had similar data
patterns and then see if near matches of individual trajectories would offer
similar outcome trajectories in those group of patients and this was inspired
by a seminal paper on case based reasoning linked here: https://
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15533257/

The pursuit of clinical problem solving using online user driven learning was a
polymathic pluralistic activity and we derived a lot of lessons from other
fields as illustrated in chapters of the UDHC book here 

https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/user-driven-learning-environment-botany/
49258

2009: The model could be scaled to the last mile primary care and act as an
efficient bridge between primary and tertiary, individual home, community
collaborative center and academic institutions as proposed here:   https://
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19811603/

2010-2020--

Many such cases started getting logged by last mile workers in various parts of
India particularly West Bengal and they were processed by a CBBLE that fed case
based problems to a global forum for conversational learning as shared here:
 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4117104/

The forum was made by global medical and engineering  students and there is
more about them in the above article as well as in the UDHC book and journal
issues here https://www.igi-global.com/journal/international-journal-user-
driven-healthcare/41022 as well as their own web pages."
