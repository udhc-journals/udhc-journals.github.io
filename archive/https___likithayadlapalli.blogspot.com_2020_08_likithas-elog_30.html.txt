Hello everyone! This is Likitha, an intern posted in General medicine
department. 

This is an online E log book to discuss our patient's de-identified health data
shared after taking his/ her /guardian's signed informed consent. 

Here we discuss our individual patient's problems through series of inputs from
available global online community of experts with an aim to solve those
patient's clinical problems with collective current best evidence based
inputs. 

This E log book also reflects my patient-centered online learning portfolio and
your valuable inputs on the comment box is welcome.

Here is a case which I have seen:-

A 50 year old male patient came to the opd on 27/08/20.
Patient was apparently symptomatic 10 years back. Patient first went to the
hospital with c/o fever, giddiness and sweating. Then local doctor observed
high blood sugars and started on OHA 10 years back. 
Later he had h/o trauma on 2nd toe of Rt LL 1 year back. Gradually his 3rd and
4th toes of Rt LL became gangrenous.
Then surgery was planned for dysarticulation and debridement of Rt 2,3,4th toes
of Rt LL.
Then 4 months later, he had swelling over Rt lower limb (base of great toe) and
gradually developed swelling and became gangrenous over 4 months to all over Rt
fore foot. 
Patient had high sugars during that period and patient consulted few doctors
for swelling and sugar controls. Regular daily dressing was done by patient
himself but as symptoms didn’t subside, patient underwent amputation 1 month
back. Since 6 months, the patient developed multiple tiny itchy swellings that
used to heal with scars (consulted few dermatologist and he was told that those
lesions were due to high blood sugars) 
6 months back patient developed localised swelling over left deltoid region
?Carbuncle and it was locally drained by a surgeon. 
Patient also had recurrent swellings all over body 5 months back. He also had
h/o carbuncle. 
Patient gives history of pain abdomen associated with vomitings 1 year back and
was diagnosed as pancreatitis. Conservative management was done.Chronic
alcoholic since 20 years, 90ml whiskey/2days.
