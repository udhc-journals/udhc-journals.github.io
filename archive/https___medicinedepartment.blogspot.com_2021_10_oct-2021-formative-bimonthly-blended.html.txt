Q1) (Testing peer review competency in the active reader of this assignment) :

Please go through the case reports in the links shared above and provide your
critical appraisal of the captured data in terms of completeness, correctness
and ability to provide useful leads to analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic
uncertainties around the cases shared.


Q2: Testing scholarship competency of the examinees ( ability to read
comprehend, analyze, reflect upon and discuss captured patient centered data):

Please analyze the above linked long and short cases patient data by first
preparing a problem list for each patient in order of perceived priority (based
on the shared data) and then discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty
around solving those problems. 

Q3) Include the review of literature around sensitivity and specificity of the
diagnostic interventions mentioned and same around efficacy of the therapeutic
interventions mentioned for each patient. 

Q4) Testing competency in patient data capture and representation through
ethical case reporting/case presentation with informed consent :

Share the link to your own case report this month of a patient that you
connected with and engaged while capturing his her sequential life events
before and after the illness and clinical and investigational images along with
your discussion of that case. 


Q 5) Testing scholarship competency in  
logging reflective observations on your concrete experiences of this last month
: (10 marks) 

Reflective logging  of one's own experiences is a vital tool toward competency
development in medical education and research.

the month can be seen in one student's  answer to Q10 in the  May 2021
assignment in the link below:
