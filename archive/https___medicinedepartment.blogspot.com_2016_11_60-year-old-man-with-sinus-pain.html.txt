Presented by 3rd semester MBBS 2015 batch Prodymna Kundu



A 60 year old man was admitted to the hospital with 

chief complaints of pain around the eyes, base & margins of the nose & back of
the head, along with severe anemia. 
  
 The pain has been a consistent problem for the last 5 years. Earlier it was a
mild pain but has increased gradually over the time. Pain is mostly stimulated
by colder objects and dust. Recently the pain has been observed to increase on
sudden exposure to sunlight & music at high level induces the pain. 
 
Complaints of dizziness vomiting and nausea were also present. Breathing
problems may be present as the patient was not able to speak at lengths and had
to be given considerable time to speak. 
 
There is no fixed duration and onset of pain. 


The patient is also suffering from Diabetes DM 2 since 10 years for which he is
currently on Insulin


BP has been normal.  

No history of Epilepsy and TB 

His elder brother had similar problems of headache and his sister is also
diabetic. 

Parents had diabetes.

No drug allergy or allergy from other substances. The patient does not smoke.
 
No history of blood transfusion.

Clinical findings were suggestive of severe anemia and on investigations the Hb
was 3 g%

A CT paranasal sinuses done outside were suggestive of a mass in his left
maxillary sinus.

The patient was evaluated by the ENT team and a nasal endoscopy revealed blood
and mucus in the left maxillary sinus which was drained but no smear for gm
stain or fungus was sent 

The patient was treated further with Blood transfusion for his anemia and
Insulin was continued for his Diabetes.

Rakesh_Biswas Regular Insulin 12 units before each meals. He also had azotemia
so long acting insulins were avoided till the azotemia recovered Boudhayan

Boudhayan_Dm How bad is the azotemia Sir.....Against popular belief Long acting
Insulins are actually no longer Contraindicated In CKD patients....We have to
be judicious while optimising the dose

Agamya_Saxena Sir, a fungal aetiology is likely.

process behind initial work up and possible diagnosis vs the final diagnosis

Prasanna_Datta The history was little bit incomplete.the patient was having
proptosis of left eye with restriction of horizental gaze for about 4
days.students missed that part.

Prasanna_Datta Firstly we thought it to be a fungal one although the ct finding
was not classical of that. We planned for a endoscopic surgery but the
patient's condition was poor.

Prasanna_Datta Then we sorted for a DNE. Surprisingly found no mass in the
nasal cavity as shown in the ct.only pus trickling from middle meatus , nasal
mucosa was inflammed nd congested. No culture nd antral wash out done.
Surprisingly the proptosis also improved. We recommended to continue the iv
antibiotics . It was not fungal polyposis as priviously thought . We ordered a
repeat ct scan. The pt has history of tooth extraction. So it may be a acute
ethmoiditis with orbital involvement
