***** How Academic Librarians Can Utilize Open Peer Review Methods to Advance Information Literacy" *****
DOI:Â https://doi.org/10.5206/elip.v3i1.8618
Citation para:

An innovafive OPR method known as "collective conversational peer review" (designed to integrate medical education and practice) exemplifies the use of an evolving creation process as a critical
appraisal tool for submitted manuscripts, which simultaneously offers medical students publication credit and interactive training (Podder et al., 2018, p. 112). This type of dynamic peer review
is an excellent example of a new information product giving participants a way to "articulate the traditional and emerging processes of information creation and dissemination in a particular
discipline" (ACRL, 2016, p. 14). By collaborating with faculty across disciplines, academic librarians can incorporate these Innovative approaches to peer review as a creative method to implement
the frame "Information Creation as a Process."

published earlier extensively in books and journals by our team.Â 

2) Developed an usage model functional prototype ofÂ Collective, user driven Â conversational peer review of real time open access research submissions"

2018-19

2) Functional prototype of a
"graphical patient timeline at a glance" to enable quick optimal clinical decision making toward improved patient outcomesÂ 

2019-2020

3) frugal bedside innovations described above including fever pattern recognition and other Â vital data pattern analysis from patient monitoringÂ 



             1. Improvements in existing products/processes/methods/techniques :

Existing processes were successfully disrupted with our newer usage modelsÂ 

             1. Â Societal outcome of the R&D activities undertaken:

Improving of health professional and patient learning outcomes along with patient health outcomesÂ 


             1. Â Import substitution (Give estimate of foreign exchange saved or likely to be saved per annum):

NA

             1. Â Linkages with industry-projects carried out on their behalf (Give details) :
