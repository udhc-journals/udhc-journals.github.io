**** A medicine intern's Web log book ****
     Hello all. I am an intern in Medicine and one of the important terms
     of getting the internship completion is to complete my log book with
     my daily log of what I learn during the course of my duties from my
     cases, the procedures that I do as well as the theory questions and
     discussion that I engage in. 


     My daily schedule for the week is detailed  here  https://
     docs.google.com/document/d/

     Our professor tells me that I need to log and record everything that
     I do and learn in the ward under three headings 

     1) Cases seen that day 

     2) Procedures seen or done that day 

     3) Theory topics learned that day 

     So here goes starting from:

Her cranial MRI images are here below and we had a lot of confusion around it
and will appreciate your inputs in the comment box:

     9) TAB.ATORVASTATIN 40 mg RT 

     11) SYP.LACTULOSE 10 ml RT TID

     12) NEB WITH MUCOMIST 6 TH         HOURLY followed by oral
     suctioning.

     18) AIR BED

     19)DVT STOCKING

     20)FREQUENT CHANGE OF POSITION 2NDHOURLY

     21) TEMPERATURE CHARTING 6th hourly.

     I asked her why were we giving her vitamin C and b complex following
     which she became angry so I thought maybe it wasn't required and she
     was angry with my finding fault with her inspite of having come late
     myself. I also wondered if the air bed and stockings were necessary.
     Again I wondered what could be the reason for her fever and why
     weren't we treating it with antibacterials to which she replied why
     was I thinking of bacteria and I asked if she had noted her WBC
     counts. They were 21,000 to which she said I was supposed to get the
     reports on time.  

     Procedure:

     My senior PG medicine thought she had a right  pleural effusion on
     examining her clinically and asked me to get an ultrasound guided
     pleural tap so that we could rule out a parapneumonic effusion as a
     possible reason for her fever. 

     I took her to my radiology senior and she reported it was very mild
     and she wasn't sure if we could get any significant fluid there
     although she would try. I watched as she cleaned the posterior
     intercostal spaces and percussed in the most dull space and then put
     her USG probe in the tenth space which she thought was dull and
     showed me a thin rim of anechoic area around the lungs suggestive of
     pleural fluid.  However once she inserted a sterile syringe needle
     she couldn't pull out any fluid and we had to abandon the procedure.
     (click here for the video) 

     In the afternoon from 2-4 we presented this case to the entire
     department. See video here. https://youtu.be/fx4Kygh6Nqc

     We had a fruitful discussion on the case where the diagnosis of pure
     hematoma to explain the intracranial space occupying lesion in her
     left basal ganglia area was contested and alternate differentials
     were discussed. 

     In the same session we also had a few topic discussions that I
     reviewed again for my NEET MCQs. Check out the video here https://
     m.youtube.com/
     watch?v=yhXqgGpfIEo&list=PLvOgc9_v4PCKsIrVK4laA3_rUJOMPAYKJ

     One such topic (check out the specific video here:https://youtu.be/
     2wBfscoXjGg)

     was about multiple myeloma where I learned about why the alkaline
     phosphatase would be normal in multiple myeloma (inspite of having
     osteolytic lesions and bone pain and I quote from the article linked
     below:

     "In Multiple myeloma, the myeloma cells activate the osteoclastic
     activity and suppress the osteoblastic activity through molecular
     pathways.

     Osteoblastic activity is seen by increased alkaline phosphatase and
     osteocalcin levels.

     Osteoclastic activity is seen by increase in collagen degradation
     product levels.

     Since the osteoblastic activity is suppressed by myeloma cells due to
     a mechanism which is not yet clearly known, serum ALP levels are
     either normal or decreased."

     The above article was actually shared by a final year PG which I have
     put as my own E log
       
     Here is the detailed MCI guideline based rationale for our daily
     roster
