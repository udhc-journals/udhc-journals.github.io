**** Virtual case based assessment post covid ****
Why Virtual case based assessment post covid? 

     What/Current status 

     The final university MD Medicine summative assessments are the usual
     exit point and opportunity for residents to ascend to a higher
     hierarchy in the healthcare ecosystem with many becoming practicing
     consultants and many going ahead for further fellowships in organ
     based specialties. 

     How/Proposed exam design 
     (as per current Council guidelines) 

     MCI guidelines for Clinical / Practical and Oral Viva examination
     quoted below verbatim from their website PDF document linked below:

     "(i) Clinical examination for the subjects in Clinical Sciences shall
     be 
     conducted to test the knowledge and competence of the candidates 
     for undertaking independent work as a specialist/Teacher, for which 
     candidates shall examine a minimum one long case and two short 
     cases.

     ii) The Oral examination shall be thorough and shall aim at
     assessing 
     the candidate knowledge and competence about the subject, 
     investigative procedures, therapeutic technique and other aspects of 
     the speciality, which form a part of the examination."

     Post covid the MCI has issued another addendum guideline that directs
     the colleges to conduct the exams in the virtual mode with virtual
     long and short cases.

     In view of the above we share below links to our virtual cases who
     are not simulations but deidentified real patients with whom our
     doctors are in regular touch through online Telemedicine virtually.
