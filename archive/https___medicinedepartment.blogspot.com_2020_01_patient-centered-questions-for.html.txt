**** Patient centered questions for assessment of "Clinical problem solving and
Medical decision making skills using EBM tools" ****
Introduction (to the question paper):

Dear student of Medicine (aka healthcare),

This is actually a formal question paper to be answered online using all
available resources at your online disposal over a period of two days. Please
submit your answers online by Monday or the nearest working day as we shall be
using your inputs to not only assess you but also to help these patients asap
as we believe your inputs reflecting your learning outcomes can be judiciously
used to improve the healthcare outcomes of these "real" patients in the
question paper. Our project is also trying to join the dots between learning
outcomes and patient healthcare outcomes.
While this is a formal question paper and many of you answering this paper are
working toward a formal licentiate degree in medicine and your inputs will
count towards analyzing your cognitive skills in "clinical problem solving"
this question paper will also be answered by a massive online audience who may
not be as privileged as you to hold a licence to practice medicine and yet we
believe their pluralistic inputs will go a long way to not only improve our
patient outcomes but they will also improve our learning outcomes as we shall
be filtering that pluralistic information to drive our patient outcomes in a
transparent process in real time. 

Please answer all questions including the MCQs linked separately below each
question description. Please feel to ask and add more questions around each one
of these "patient centered questions" as YOUR clarifications and patient
centered queries will help us develop further insights and we shall also assess
your ability to ask questions (either Socratic or in a PICO format toward
critical appraisal). Please feel free to google any  of the terminologies that
you don't understand here. For those of you who have seen these current
patients please share more information details about them that can enrich our
systems thinking about their problem. 

You can either deposit your answer in the comment box or and
email to kimsjbcr@gmail.com (the formal  email address for our journal that can
be accessed here https://jbcr.net.in/) and or whatsapp to 9121046928 (this
number cannot be called but just messaged with your name and you will receive
an acknowledgement). 

We hope you will get used to this new format of assessing you once the shock
value and novelty wears off. Just remember every information input that you
provide to us around these questions will go a long way to help our patient
teachers (more about them here

1) A 35 yr old man complains of shortness of breath since 2 weeks and pedal
edema since 2 weeks
patient was apparently asymptomatic 1 month back then he developed fever ,
associated with chills ,which is high grade for which he took treatment at
local rmp where he was given antimalarial drugs and treated symptomatically
after which patient felt better. currently from 2 weeks he is complaining of b/
l pedal edema, extending upto knees, pitting type, progressing in nature
shortness of breath from 2 weeks, initially NYHA grade III ,after treatment now
grade II
h/o paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and generalised weakness from 2 weeks
no h/o fever,vomitings, abdominal distension, diarrhea, cough,cold

On examination, general examination reveals reduced muscle mass in limbs, large

Questions:

1)What could be the differentials postulated as possible etiologies and
pathophysiologies for his clinical presentation? 

2) What are the diagnostic sensitivity and specificities of various modalities
including clinical testing and other investigations for establishing a single
diagnostic hypothesis for this patient with a fair degree of certainty? Please
discuss and quote from available studies that you can come across to find the
above and mention your search strategy for each study. 

3) What are the various therapeutic options/interventions for this patient?
Please discuss the efficacy of each option/intervention quoting in a PICO
format from studies that you can find around the efficacy of each intervention.
Please share your search strategy for each of the possible interventions.

2) A 62 year old man with diabetes since last twenty years and hypertension
since ten years complains of shortness of breath and pedal edema since three
years. He also complains of intermittent claudication pain of both lower limbs
after walking for around 250 meters since last three years which subsides even
with standing for a few minutes. He also complains of episodes of giddiness
after walking and has been noted to have regular day time somnolence along
episodes of nocturnal awakenings due to shortness of breath punctuated by
snoring. He also complained of sudden diminished vision of one eye three months
back.  

On examination he has large trunkal obesity and bilateral pedal edema along
with hyperpigmentation of the skin and "peau de orange." His fundoscopy
revealed a recovering vitreous hemorrhage with proliferative diabetic
retinopathy. 

On investigations, his pulmonary function test and 2D Echo and an adenosine
driven thallium perfusion scan turn out to be normal. His Hb is 8g % with
microcytic hypochromic anemia with reduced serum iron, reduced transferrin
saturation and TIBC with normal serum ferritin. His serum creatinine is 1.9 mg
% and his urine 24 hour protein excretion is around 2 g%. His blood sugar
profile is controlled on insulin glargine at night and plain insulin thrice
before meals. His Hba1c is 6.5. Sleep study showed multiple episodes of sleep
apnoea during REM sleep and Doppler examination of lower limbs revealed normal
arterial flow. An MRI lumbosacral spine showed mild lumbar canal stenosis.  

Questions:

1) For his shortness of breath and pedal edema, what are the various further
options for investigating him in the lines of COPD or heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)  and what factors will make you weigh in
further on either of these differentials for his shortness of breath and pedal
edema? 

2) What are the available further diagnostic and therapeutic options to manage
his: 

a)anemia associated with chronic kidney disease and possible iron deficiency? 

b) proliferative retinopathy with vitreous hemorrhage?

c) HFpEF vs COPD vs angina equivalent?

d) Obstructive sleep apnoea 

e) Lower limb intermittent claudication 

f) Giddiness and near syncope on walking (? Vertebro basilar insufficiency)? 

Which option will you choose for this patient and why? Please discuss the
efficacy of each option/intervention quoting in a PICO format from studies that
you can find around the efficacy of each intervention. Please share your search
strategy for each of the possible interventions.

3) A 29 year old man with a strong family history of stroke and renal failure
develops a fever of unknown origin FUO since last three months and on clinical
examination is found to be cachectic with tachypnoea and a large right sided
pleural effusion which on aspiration is found to be hemorrhagic and exudative
with lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal pleural fluid ADA and negative
CBNAAT. 

He also has severe anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypertension, proteinuria,
azotemia, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, bleeding diathesis and is begun
on regular hemodialysis. His Echocardiography assessments reveal severe
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy LVH with preserved ejection fraction. 

While he's also got good transplant prospects due to the availability of a live
related donor (his mother), the bigger challenge is to diagnose his fever and
large right sided pleural effusion along with controlling his hypertension and
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction HFpEF. 

Questions:

1) What would be your further management plan for diagnosing his FUO and
pleural effusion? Would you resort to a therapeutic trial for a commonly
suspected infective pathology? What would be the role of a video assisted
thoracoscopic biopsy in such a situation? 

2) What could be the possible pathological  reason for his familial renal
failure and hypertension with a strong history of hypertension and stroke also
in his other family members? 

3) How would you manage his severe anemia? What are the advantages or
disadvantages of multiple blood transfusions before renal transplant with
regard to graft rejection? What is the role of erythropoetin stimulating agents
in patients of dialysis? His iron profile shows increased serum ferritin,
reduced serum iron and transferrin saturation. How would you decide if he needs
correction for iron deficiency as well? 

4) What are the tests to determine chances of graft rejection prior to renal
transplant?
