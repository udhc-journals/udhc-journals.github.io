is closest to your own roll number :

Q2) Share the link to your own case report of a patient that you connected with
and engaged while capturing his her sequential life events before and after the
illness and clinical and investigational images along with your discussion of
that case. 

Q3) (Testing peer review competency of the examinees) :

Please go through the cases in the links shared above and provide your critical
appraisal of the captured data in terms of completeness, correctness and
ability to provide useful leads to analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic
uncertainties around the cases shared.

Q4: Testing scholarship competency of the examinees ( ability to read
comprehend, analyze, reflect upon and discuss captured patient centered data as
in their 'original' answers to the assignment for May 2021):

Please analyze the above linked patient data by first preparing a problem list
for each patient (based on the shared data) and then discuss the diagnostic and
therapeutic uncertainty around solving those problems. Also include the review
of literature around sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic
interventions mentioned and same around efficacy of the therapeutic
interventions mentioned for each patient. 

Q 5) Testing scholarship competency in  
logging reflective observations on your concrete experiences of this last month
: (10 marks) 

Reflective logging  of one's own experiences is a vital tool toward competency
development in medical education and research. 

A sample answer to this last assignment around sharing your experience log of
the month can be seen in one student's  answer to Q10 in the  May 2021
assignment in the link below:

https://drsaranyaroshni.blogspot.com/2021/05/assignment-patient-centred-
learning.html?m=1

Please reflect on and share  your telemedical learning experiences from the
 hospital as well as community  patients over the last month particularly while
you were E logging their case report while even in the hospital or perhaps when
locked down at home.
