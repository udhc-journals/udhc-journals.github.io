**** Failed political integration attempts at different roads to healing in the
USA ****
Quoted verbatim from the reference link below :
https://www.irma-international.org/article/caught-middle-divide-between-
conventional/52621/

In 2000 President Clinton, mindful of rising healthcare costs and growing
evidence of the benefits of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM),
commissioned a panel to study the possibility that CAM could reduce healthcare
costs as well as improve the general health of the American population (White
House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy, 2002)
 The leaders of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative
Medicine Policy gathered an esteemed panel, solicited public input, and
navigated the differences of opinion between those who believe in the worth of
CAM and those who were skeptical or downright negative, or so they thought. 
After years of negotiation, two of the committee members felt their views were
not sufficiently considered and wrote a letter to the secretary of Heath and
Human Services that negated the heart of the panel’s conclusions….there was the
possibility of benefit from a more holistic, far-reaching, and often long-
standing approach to healing and more research was warranted. (Fins and Low
Dog, 2002) The committee’s recommendations were effectively tabled and
forgotten."
