**** Usage and creation of E learning resources by our departmental local and
global CBBLE ****
All the E learning resources used and created by our departmental local and
global CBBLE (case based blended learning ecosystem) was done to meet the
demands of our regular learning and patient care workflow. More details about
our CBBLE (case based blended learning ecosystem)  available in this
publication here : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163835/

**** Daily workflow of our case based blended learning ecosystem aka CBBLE (and
links to E resources utilized)  ****

Our regular patient centered learning workday begins with our post graduate
residents meeting our patients in the wards and ICUs from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM
while one unit batch of post graduates look after the outpatient that opens at
9:00 AM.  A tabular summary of our daily workflow is linked here: http://
medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/02/medicine-department-time-table.html?m=0
and below we also provide links to the E resources utilized. 

E learning resource 1: online discussion group 

Ours is a blended offline and online learning program with our offline interns
and residents beginning the day by sharing our last night new admissions and
overall inpatient data and their experiences in meeting those patient
challenges in our local CBBLE, which is an online discussion group accessible
only to group members where individual  case details are shared as individual
 case report links after patient deidentification and signed informed consent.

E learning resource 2: online archived videos of ward rounds and flipped
classroom sessions.  


Once the patients shared in the online group are discussed thoroughly by all
departmental students and faculty, the rounds begin in the manner below :

(in the above example our rounds were archived as a youtube video learning
resource for globally interested students) 

UG teaching learning workflow in medicine begins at 11:00 -1:00 PM post 8-10
AM- PG rounds and 10-11AM- UG case taking followed by 11:00-1:00 AM unit wise
UG case presentation and discussion.

All videos of our teaching learning workflow beginning with theory lecture
classes in flipped classrooms as well as practical case and procedural
demonstrations are captured, created and archived here as an E learning
resource : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvYjjuT_hEEQDtlHSAvFdRpCb5EBszwgR
