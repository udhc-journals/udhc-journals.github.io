**** Blended bimonthly assessment Dec 2020-Jan 2021 results ****
 


          Following are the links to the submitted assignments by the
          students (interns, PGs year 1 and year 2) for the the
          assignment posted for 16/12/2020 here 
          https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/12/medicine-
          question-paper-for-december.html?m=0 and the assignment
          posted for 16/01/2020 here 
          https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/01/?m=0
          and in the links below one can find that the summative has
          been also accompanied by a numerical formative assessment
          of their online learning portfolios using both verbal and
          non verbal cues. 

          Interns from 2015 MBBS batch posted in the department of
          Medicine from  23.11.2020 to 21.01.2021

          The formative assessment has been divided into non-verbal
          which assesses their competency in procedural domains
          including empathic communication and body language and
          verbal which assesses their ability to communicate their
          work through their day to day E logs.


          Most students have done reasonably in the formative
          assessment in both verbal and non verbal communication
          domains although a lot remains to be improved on. 


          Most students haven't done well at all in the summative
          assessment as they are still trying to get a hang of how to
          express themselves in an online open access world where
          their answers are meant to create a societal impact rather
          than impress just one examiner who may end up giving good
          numerical scores in appreciation of their ability to answer
          from rote memorized facts as per tradition. It's possible
          that in the current phase of evolution we may find that
          many have not only plagiarised blatantly from articles on
          the internet (inspite of express instructions on how not to
          resort to that) but also copy pasted from each other's log
          books.
