                    Questions plan and context:
All questions are around student driven patient centered case reports prepared
by our students from our real but deidentified patients. These cases have also
been discussed in theory lectures as well as practical training sessions which
are available here : https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/10/updated-
october-2021-weekly-log-and.html?m=0

Please review one E logged case report link around our current cases (uploaded
anywhere between a few days of this post) by one of our 2016, 2017, 2018 and
2019 students in their links available from the LOR link below :

Q1) (Testing peer review competency in the active reader of this assignment) :

Please go through the current case reports in the links shared above and
provide your critical appraisal of the captured data in terms of completeness,
correctness and ability to provide useful leads to analyze the diagnostic and
therapeutic uncertainties around the cases shared.


Q2: Testing scholarship competency of the examinees ( ability to read
comprehend, analyze, reflect upon and discuss captured patient centered data):

Please analyze the linked case report current patient data by first preparing a
problem list for each patient in order of perceived priority (based on the
shared data) and then discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty around
solving those problems. 

Q3) Include the review of literature around sensitivity and specificity of the
diagnostic interventions mentioned and same around efficacy of the therapeutic
interventions mentioned for each patient. 

Q4) Testing leadership competency in patient data capture and representation
through ethical case reporting/case presentation with informed consent from
body language of the presenter :

Share the link to your own case report this month of a patient that you
connected with and engaged while capturing his her sequential life events
before and after the illness and clinical and investigational images along with
your discussion of that case. 

Please attach a link to your latest YouTube video of your case presentation to
assess your current leadership competency expressed in non verbal cues. Check
out other shared YouTube videos of prior student's presentations here : https:/
/youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvYjjuT_hEEQDtlHSAvFdRpCb5EBszwgR


Q 5) Testing scholarship competency in  
logging reflective observations on your concrete experiences of this last month
: (10 marks) 

Reflective logging  of one's own experiences is a vital tool toward competency
development in medical education and research.

the month can be seen in one student's  answer to Q10 in the  May 2021
assignment in the link below:
