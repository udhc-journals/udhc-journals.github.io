**** 2017 to 2021 Eco friendly Medicine department sample conferences ****
Low cost eco friendly conferences, workshops, training courses are conducted
all the year round by the medicine department as per the mandate of our CBBLE
research project toward continuing medical education and integrating it with
medical practice. 

The conferences are primarily hosted in Tabula rasa while the information flow
is gathered from every user driven learning point in social media ranging from
those gathered by the local hosts from the department of Medicine as well as
those that are gathered in Tabula rasa itself.
