Out of the 60 hyponatremia patients studied, only 2 patients have severe
Hyponatremia, majority of patients have mild asympomatic hyponatremia.
Most of the cases of mild hyponatremia are secondary to chronic kidney 
Disease.

Most common cause of hyponatremia in present study is 
Hypervolumic hyponatremia secondary to chronic kidney 
Disease. Second most common cause being SIADH followed by 
Hypovolemia which is secondary to vomitings,loose stools and 
Dehydration. 
Hypothyroidism alone rarely causes hyponatremia. Hypothyroidism
Need to be severe (myxedema coma) to cause hyponatremia.
 Most of the mixed Causes of hyponatremia are associated 
with hypothyroidism. In most of the mixed causes of hyponatremia 
which one actually lead to hyponatremia remains Unclear.

                       DISCUSSION
The present study included patients with serum sodium less than 
130meq/l. there were 42 males and 18 females with ratio of 2.3 : 1 .
In general, more number of males were admitted in KIMS, Narketpally 
When compared to females . so no conclusion was made on this 
Difference in incidence.

In present study, hyponatremia was seen more commomly in patients
 above 45 years of age than in younger patients. youngest patient with 
hyponatremia in our study is of 25 years age. Eldest patient is of 87 years 
age. Incidence of hyponatremia is higher in elderly patients similar 
trend was also observed by Hochman (9) and Vurgese (10) in their study

The hydration status in the present study was noted based on clinical 
Examination like capillary refilling time, jugular venous pulse, blood 
Pressure, pressure or absence of pedal edema and IVC (inferior vena 
Cava diameter) .Hydration status was divided into euvolumic, 
Hypovolemic and hypervolemic states. In the present study 26 patients 
Were hypovolemic, 22 patients were hypervolemic and 9 patients were
Euvolumic representing 43%, 37% and 15% respectively.

In the present study hypervolumic cases are more compared to Hochman 
Study. Most of them are secondary to chronic kidney disease as in our 
Hospital locality (Nalgonda district) renal failure is commonly which was 
Thought to be due to fluorosis. Hypovolemia cases slightly higher than 
Both the studies. Most of the hypovolemic cases are due to vomitings, 
Loose stools and dehydration. Study also includes surgical causes of 
Vomiting which leads to hyponatremia.
Euvolumic cases are less compared to Hochman and Anderson studies
In the present study may due to underdiagnosis of adrenal insufficiency 
In our hospital setting and also relatively more cases of ESRD (end stage
Renal disease) which contribute to hypervolumic hyponatremia. 

The mean age was 58.4 years. The commonest age group affected was
40 to 79 years. The commonest cause of hyponatremia was chronic 
Kidney disease and vomitings,loose stools and dehydration. Next 
Common cause was SIADH which was secondary to pneumonia,
Pulmonary tuberculosis and sub arachnoid hemorrhage.

In study done by vurgese, the incidence of hyponatremia was 3.6%
With the defnation of hyponatremia as serum sodium levels less than
Or equal to 130meq/l. the study population consisted of 66 patients with
56% 
males and 44 % females. The mean age was 57.07 years. The 
Commonest age group affected was 45 to 64 years (72.8 %) and the least
Affected group was 12 to 25 years.

Hyponatremia cases in the present study were also distributed based on 
serum sodium level. Most of the cases of hyponatremia are with the 
serum sodium level between the range of 120 to 129 meq/l (39 patients 
out of 60 ). most of the cases with mild hyponatremia are hypervolemic 
secondary to chronic kidney disease.


In the present study, In patients with euvolumic hyponatremia, 9 patients 

satisfied the criteria to diagnose SIADH. They had low serum osmolality, 

high urine osmolality and high urine sodium. However, in brain injury

cases like cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) if patient presents 

with hyponatremia probable diagnosis of hyponatremia can be kept as 

SIADH or cerebral salt wasting syndrome. Clear cut differentiation

Between SIADH and cerebral salt wasting syndrome will be very difficult 

In the first 24 hours as important differentiating feature between SIADH 

And cerebral salt wasting syndrome is urine output.


Hypovolemic cases of hyponatremia are secondary to acute 

Gastroenteritis mostly due to Ecoli, salmonella and staph aureus.

Surgical causes of vomiting like intestional obstruction, pyloric stenosis,

Appendicitis and renal colic also contributed to hypovolemic causes of 

Hyponatremia. Thiazide diuretics usuage in patients with hypertention 

And chronic renal disease also contributed to hypovolemic 

hyponatremia.

Hyponatremia secondary to anti psychotic drugs presented with 

increased thirst, patient drank 6 to 7 litres of water for 2 days and 

passed only 1 to 2 litres of urine each day for 2 days.


Thyroid function tests and adrenal function

Thyroid function tests and random serum cortisol test was done in all
 
this patients. There are 2 cases of hypothyroidism, in both the patients

 cause of hypothyroidism is mixed. In one patient cause of hyponatremia 

 is both hypothyroidism and thiazide diuretics volume status in this

patient is hypovolemic. In another case cause of cause of hyponatremia 
is both hypothyroidism and vomitings secondary to acute illness like 

dengue. 

Patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia are 26 patients (43 %) among 

60 Patients of hyponatremia. Cause of hypovolemic hyponatremia is 

Mostly dehydration. Other cause of hypovolemic hyponatremia is 

Cerebral salt wasting syndrome. In present study there are 4 cases of

Hypovolemic hyponatremia are cerebral salt wasting syndrome.

Majority of cases in  present study are of hypervolumic hyponatremia

Chronic kidney disease is the major cause of hypervolumic 

Hyponatremia. Other causes are dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic liver 

Disease and mixed causes like CCF + CLD +CKD. Patients with mild 

hyponatremia are almost always asymptomatic. Severe hyponatremia is 

usually associated with central nervous system symptoms and can be 

life-threatening. Diagnostic evaluation of patients with hyponatremia is

 directed toward identifying the extracellular fluid volume status, the 

neurological symptoms and signs, the severity and duration of 

hyponatremia, the rate at which hyponatremia developed. The first step

 to determine the probable cause of hyponatremia is the differentiation of 

the hypervasopressinemic and non-hypervasopressinemic 

hyponatremias with measurement of plasma osmolality, glucose, lipids 

and proteins. For further differential diagnosis of hyponatremia, the

 determination of urine osmolality, the clinical assessment of 

extracellular fluid volume status and the measurement of urine sodium 

concentration provide important information. The most important

 representative of euvolemic hyponatremias is SIADH. The diagnosis of 

SIADH is based on the exclusion of other hyponatremic conditions; low 

plasma osmolality (<275 mosmol/kg) and inappropriate urine 

concentration (urine osmolality >100 mosmol/kg) are of pathognomic 

value. Acute (<48 hrs) severe hyponatremia (<120 mmol/l) necessitates 

emergency care with rapid restoration of normal osmotic milieu

 (1 mmol/l/hr increase rate of serum sodium). Patients with chronic 

symptomatic hyponatremia have a high risk of osmotic demyelination 

syndrome in brain if rapid correction of the plasma sodium occurs 

(maximal rate of correction of serum sodium should be 0.5 mmol/l/hr or

 less). The conventional treatments for chronic asymptomatic 

hyponatremia (except hypovolemic patients) include water restriction 

and/or the use of demeclocycline or lithium or furosemide and salt 

supplementation. Vasopressin receptor antagonists have opened a new

 forthcoming therapeutic era. V2 receptor antagonists, such as 

lixivaptan, tolvaptan, satavaptan and the V2+V1A receptor antagonist 

conivaptan promote the electrolyte-sparing excretion of free water and 

lead to increased serum sodium





TREATMENT AND MONITORING

Monitoring of sodium was done on a 6 hourly to12 hourly basis in most 

Of the patients with symptomatic and severe hyponatremia. 

Fluid correction depended on the type, cause and presence of 

symptoms.

The mean rate of correction was adequate and comparable with most of 

The international studies. Normal saline alone, 3% saline, fluid 

restriction, + duration, dialysis, steroids alone and in combination were 

used to treat symptomatic and severe hyponatremia.

 Excessive antidiuretic hormone and continued fluid intake are the 

pathogenetic causes of these hyponatremias. Whereas hypovolemic 

hyponatremia is best corrected by isotonic saline, conventional 

proposals for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia consist of the 

following: fluid restriction, lithium carbonate, demeclocycline, urea and 

loop diuretic. None of these nonspecific treatments is entirely 

satisfactory. Recently a new class of pharmacological agents -orally 

available vasopressin antagonists, collectively called vaptans- have 

been described. A number of clinical trials using vaptans have been 

performed already. They showed vaptans to be effective, specific and 

safe in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.  

vaptans generally had favorable effects on fluid balance

 also. To date two vaptans, ie, conivaptan and tolvaptan, have been 

marketed in the United States for the treatment of euvolemic and 

hypervolemic hyponatremia, whereas tolvaptan has been marketed in 

Europe with the limitation of euvolemic hyponatremia. Although these 

drugs have a good safety profile, caution should be used, and treatment 

should be initiated in a hospital setting in order to closely monitor

 patients and avoid overly rapid correction or overcorrection. Vaptans 

can be considered a new effective tool for the treatment of euvolemic 

and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Nevertheless, more comparative 

research of vaptans vs other therapies on clinical grounds is needed to 

more accurately assess the value of these drugs in the treatment of 

hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia causes serious brain swelling that 

can lead to permanent disability or death. A 4-6 mEq/l increase in serum

 sodium is sufficient to reverse impending herniation. Brain swelling is 

minimal in chronic hyponatremia, and to avoid osmotic demyelination,

 correction should not exceed 8 mEq/l/day. In high-risk patients, 

correction should not exceed 4-6 mEq/l/day. Inadvertent overcorrection

 of hyponatremia is common and preventable by controlling unwanted 

urinary water losses with desmopressin. Even mild chronic 

hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, attention deficit, 

gait instability, osteoporosis, and fractures, but it is not known if the 

correction of mild hyponatremia improves outcomes.

 Controlled trials are needed to identify affordable treatments for 

hyponatremia that reduce the need for hospitalization, decrease hospital

 length of stay, and decrease morbidity. Such trials could also help

 answer the question of whether hyponatremia causes excess mortality

 or whether it is simply a marker for severe, lethal, underlying disease
