-fish mouth appearance 





based on the above investigations, the provisional diagnosis is MITRAL STENOSIS
with HEART FAILURE.

TREATMENT:
1.INJ.LASIX 2amp in 50ml NS @8mg/hr
2.oxygenation to maintain spO2 above 95%
3.nebulization with budecort 12th hourly
4.strict I/O charting
5.monitoring BP,PR hourly
6.fluid and salt restriction
7.head end elevation
8.inj.amiodarone 300mg (2amp) at 6ml/hr
9.inj.pantop 40mg/OD/iv
10.T. ecosprin 75mg/PO/OD


(some insight in the case's history= patient was a agricultural labourer 5
years ago, mostly into plantation in paddy fields, occasionally did labour of
carrying the harvest, which eventually caused her weakness and she had to
quit!)
