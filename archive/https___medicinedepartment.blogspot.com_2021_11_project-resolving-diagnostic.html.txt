[11/21, 9:22 AM] moderator : USG abdomen revealed any perinephric abscess?

[11/21, 9:22 AM] PG Med: No sir it did not reveal any abscess, there is no loin
tenderness on palpation

[11/21, 9:22 AM] : Â moderator
Start him on iv Meropenem today asap

11/21, 9:22 AM] PG Med: Ok sir

[11/21, 9:23 AM] Moderator : Share his blood sugar trends since admission


[11/21, 7:02 PM] Moderator : Why did we add falcigo when the localization was
pointing towards UTI? ðŸ¤”

[11/21, 7:17 PM] PG Med: Sir because of the spike every 12 hours ,

[11/21, 7:19 PM] Moderator : Why didn't we think it was UTI

[11/21, 7:21 PM] Â PG Med: Yes sir his fever had chills each episode,true for
uti,Â 
We thought of malaria as well sir , inspite of antibiotics frequency or temp
didn't come down

[11/21, 7:21 PM] Moderator : So purely from our medical cognition research
insight perspective one can conclude that in the face of diagnostic uncertainty
that keeps continuously giving irritating alarms, doctors often tend to cover
all the differential diagnostic possibilities and reduce the chances of their
future regret?

[11/21, 7:39 PM] PG Med: Sir may I ask, why did we choose meropenem for this
patient?

[11/21, 7:40 PM] moderator :Â 

The answer is here ðŸ‘‰([11/21, 7:02 PM] Moderator : Why did we add falcigo when
the localization was pointing towards UTI? ðŸ¤”)

I didn't even notice that he had been started on empirical falcigo from
yesterday evening

Meropenem was the antibiotic escalation for the strong differential of UTI in
the moderator's mind although rest of the team thought falcigo was good
enough.Â 

Medical cognition Inferential queries:

Could we have held back on antibiotic escalation if the PG Med had voiced her
query regarding meropenem earlier instead of immediately agreeing to switch
over?Â 

What really helped the patient? Falcigo or meropenem? Â Â

Â 
PG Med Yes he has a spike of 102 now

11/22, 7:37 PM] Moderator : Subjectively?


[11/22, 7:39 PM] PG Med: At the time of spike ,he is having chills sir ,but not
as disabling as the rest of the times as per him,Â 
Rest of the time he's comparatively more active


[11/22, 7:39 PM] moderatorÂ : This sounds like malaria ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜¬


[11/22, 7:40 PM] moderator : Are we still continuing the Artemesin?


[11/22, 7:40 PM] PG Med: Yes sir , but he already has taken 3 doses of falcigo
so far


[11/22, 7:40 PM] PG Med: The 48th hour dose is due tomorrow morning at 8 sir


[11/22, 7:40 PM] Moderator : What is the continuation strategy for falcigo in
toto?


[11/22, 7:42 PM] Â PG Med: Should have voiced about giving falcigo and notified
the initial dip so that meropenem wouldn't have been started sir,Â 
His loin pain is more musculoskeletal than pyelonephritis as he's having it on
bending .


[11/22, 7:47 PM] PG Med: 2.4mg/kg at 0,12,24 and 48 hrs sir


[11/22, 7:49 PM] Moderator : Hmm that would have saved some meropenem.Â 
How about reviewing the repeat urine culture and if negative for a second time
we can stop meropenem?


[11/22, 8:09 PM] Moderator : Yesterday in the 2016 group someone said the urine
routine was showing 8-10 pus cells although the prior RBCs had receded. What
could be the reason for that? He also gave a history of hematuria with his loin
pain in the initial phases?


[11/22, 8:43 PM] PG Med: Sir the transient haematuria can be due to uti itself,
due to inflammation, his symptoms of burning micturition subsided when the
repeat cue (complete urinary examination) came back negative for rbc as well


[11/22, 8:47 PM] Moderator : But he had 8-10 pus cells.Â 

How many pus cells did he have when he had 3-4 RBCs?


[11/22, 10:21 PM] PG Med: On the day of admission he had 3-4 pus cells with 3-
4 rbc's
Repeated cue on Saturday has 8 to 10 pus cells ,with 1-2 rbc sir

November 19, 2021

FridayÂ 

Group discussion:Â 

Context : PUO in a male diabetic with loin pain and lower urinary tract
symptoms of urgency and burningÂ 

https://prashanthsharma101.blogspot.com/2021/11/a-case-of-39-year-old-
male.html?m=1

Presenters : Dr Vaishnavi, Dr Nikita, Dr Pooja (intern) and Dr (Soujanya 2017)


Impact :Â 

On learning ecosystem :

Cognitive competency levels touched :

Approach to clinical localization of disease pathology was done reasonably well
and differential diagnostic hypothesis formulated in the face of high
diagnostic and therapeutic uncertaintyÂ 

On patient care outcomes :

Empathic trust built with patient and relativesÂ 

Standard of care provided with provision for care continuity Â 

Challenges met/not met :Â 

Fever monitoring and post admission illness timeline was well supervised.Â 

Imaging and labs for further Â clinical localization of the PUO was driven by
the discussionÂ 

Multiple therapeutic interventions were made for the differentials in the face
of diagnostic uncertainty further driven by ongoing patient suffering and an
attempt to gather the "medical cognition" learning points made here :Â
