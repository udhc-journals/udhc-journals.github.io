**** Making connections between different ways of knowing and doing ****

In the above framework of what is just one stream of healthcare delivery among
other delivery frameworks, we cite below a patient centered example of another
closely related healthcare delivery framework that the British subjugated 200
years back and the following description of the patient problem representation
has been shared in an empathic narrative format by a research scholar of that
original Indian stream:

old-uc.html?m=1
The above narrative reveals an Indian patient's 'quest' for cure taking him
away from mainstream medicine and making him embrace other streams, including
Ayurveda and finding a respite although short lived as it worsens again and
makes him again having to approach mainstream medical practitioners who have
the dominant hold on a large number of delivery modalities that are often
related to non pharmacological engineering  technology for example putting an
endoscope into the patient's colon or getting a diagnostic imaging and as a
result of that hold they are able to also institute therapies that are
manufactured by the ruling big pharma drug industry.
Here is another Indian patient narrative

inflammatory.html?m=1, this time by a doctor himself experiencing a chronic
illness and eventually integrating on his own various ways of knowing and
learning about his disease to eventually find a solution, similar to the global
representation we had earlier provided to set the context to scholarly
integration of medical education for it's primary beneficiaries aka patients.
