MEDICINE LOG BOOK BY SAI BHAVANA SANA - ROLL NUMBER - 146 This is an online E
log book to discuss our patient's de-identified health data shared after taking
his/her/guardian's signed informed consent. Here, we discuss our individual
patient's problems through series of inputs from available global online
community of experts with an aim to solve those patient's clinical problems
with collective current best evidence based inputs

**** Paraparesis 2 ****
"I've been given this case
https://hitesh116.blogspot.com/2020/05/elog-13th-may-2020.html?m=1
¬†to solve in an attempt to understand the topic of "paraparesis."

This may develop my competency in

a) reading and comprehending clinical data related to "paraparesis" including
history, clinical findings, investigations

b) come up with a diagnosis such as:
1) Anatomical location of the root cause
2) Physiological functional disability
3) Biochemical abnormalities that could be a root cause at a molecular level
4) Pathology that could reflect the root cause at a cellular level

c) a treatment plan for each of these patients of paraparesis that can have a
pharmacological and non pharmacological component.

d) learning the scientific basis of diagnostic and therapeutic approach in
terms of past collective experiences and experiments (aka evidence based
medicine).

Following is my analysis of patient's problem.

A 18 year old male patient presented with weakness of both lower limbs which is
acute in onset.

*** Based_on_history¬† ***
*** There is no sensory involvement, no involuntary movements, no cerebellar
involvement.So I cut done my differential diagnosis to upper motor neuron
lesion and lower motor neuron lesion. ***
*** Based_on_examination ***
Findings of examination show that there is atophy, hypotonia, absent deep
tendon reflexes and babinski is neagative.
Based on this finding I confine my diagnosis to LMN lesion.Now problem arises
where exactly is the site of lesion as LMN involves anterior horn cell,dorsal
root ganglion, spinal nerve root , peripheral nerve, NMJ, and muscle.

To know where the exact site of lesion, we need to first ask following
questions:
    * symmetrical or asymmetrical¬†
    * proximal or distal
    * sensory or motor
    * reflexes present or absent
So by answering to the above question,in this case there is symmetrical
weakness of both proximal and distal lower limbs muscles and deep tendon
reflexes are absent.There is motor involvement.From this findings my
differential diagnosis is myopathyand peripheral neuropathy.¬†

So now the aim is to know whether it is MYOPATHY OR NEUROPATHY.And if myopathy
what is the main pathology. How can this be done???

First I will try to know what can be the pathology related to¬† myopathy in this
case.So looking to the history once again we can come to know that there is
persistent weakness.What can¬† cause persistant weakness??
¬† ¬† ¬†It could be due to certain type of drugs but then in this case there not
history of use of them.Next what comes to my mind is hypothyroidism, for this
we have to check his thyriod profile.After checking the thyroid profile, it was
normal.So this possibility is also ruled out.Now we are left will inflammatory
pathology such as polymyositis. For this muscle biopsy can be done.

So my differential diagnosis for this case is still left withPOLYMYOSITISand
PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY.

To know whether the nerve involvement is present or not, nerve conduction
studies /EMG can done
After performing NCS it is known that there is common peroneal nerve and sural
neuropathy. Physiotherapy can advised to the patient.

*** Now final diagnosis can be made as NEUROPATHY,¬† but then what happens to
MYOPATHY.??Whether it can be POLYMYOSITIS ????To know about this muscle biopsy
should be done. ***

      "[5/23, 8:53 AM] MBBS 2016 student: Sir in this case why can‚Äôt there be
      an inflammatory cause such polymyositis
      https://hitesh116.blogspot.com/2020/05/elog-13th-may-2020.html
      [5/23, 8:54 AM]:MBBS 2016 student Why only peripheral neuropathy is
      diagnosed
      [5/23, 9:02 AM] Postresidency PG1: Very good question.

      So the challenge is to distinguish between these two differentials that
      are essentially two different anatomical locations of the possible
      pathology.

      What are the clinical signs and symptoms that can distinguish neuropathy
      from myopathy is the real question?
      [5/23, 9:20 AM]MBBS 2016 student: In neuropathy there may or may not be
      sensory involvement but in myopathy there is no loss of sensation .
      In myopathy proximal muscles are affected first whereas in neuropathy
      distal muscles are involved and there is early atrophy
      [5/23, 9:25 AM] Postresidency PG1: üëçüëèüëè
      [5/23, 9:26 AM] Postresidency PG1: üëç

      Now check out these in the two patients and then question the diagnosis
      [5/23, 9:28 AM]MBBS 2016 student: Reflexes are present
      No loss of sensation
      Muscle tenderness
      This features go with myopathy more than neuropathy
      [5/23, 9:28 AM] MBBS 2016 student: Thank you sirüôÇ"
