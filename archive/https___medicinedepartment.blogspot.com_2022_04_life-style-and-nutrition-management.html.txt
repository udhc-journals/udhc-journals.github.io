**** Life style and nutrition management through integrative medicine practice
and education ****
 
This project will be illustrated through patient centered case studies. 

Our prior similar projects are published here :

Two case studies of today 5/4/2022

Case 1 :

Case 2:

Integrative medical education and practice twist :

Life style choices 1:

Psychosocial component :

Even as we started trying to change Case 1's life style and nutrition, we also
got Case 1 to look after Case 2 as part of our life style modification program
related to deaddiction and other life style changes toward giving our patients
a better psycho social and metabolic profile enhancing their individual
leadership and scholarship driving better collective societal gains. Above
mentioned medical education project has been conceptualized earlier in this
book chapter here : https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/06/draft-3a-
scholarship-of-integration-and.html?m=0

We made Case 1 present the problem based requirements of Case 2 in our 11AM to
1PM morning academic session also attended by 100s of our graduate medical
students. One of the medical students was already presenting one of her
patients of alcoholic cirrhosis and following her presentation once our Case 1
finished his presentation around Case 2, we had a fruitful discussion around
Case 2 as well as Case 1 where we tried to discuss the similarities between the
alcohol addiction of Case 1 and the previously medical student presented
Alcoholic cirrhosis patient in a non judgemental manner highlighting the
complications the first patient suffered from alcohol addiction. 

Our objectives and expectations from this patient driven learning exercise was
manifold :

1) Demonstrate harms of a particular life style 

2) Demonstrate the positive outcome possibilities of a changed lifestyle 

3) Build confidence in the patient currently experiencing the harmful lifestyle
that s/he can change for the better 

Current life style challenges identified in Case 1 from the case report linked
above :

1) Psychological debility due to tragic life events leading to attempted acute
(organo phosphorus poisoning) self harm as well as chronic self harm (alcohol
addiction) 

2) Medical complications of psychological self harm manifesting in metabolic
syndrome (type 2 diabetes) as well as recurrent pancreatitis and possibly type
3 diabetes. 

Life style interventions instituted and ongoing along with expected outcomes:

1) Patient empowerment through practical hands on knowledge and learning of
clinical problem solving that would enable scholarship and leadership and not
only help to solve the patient's own life style challenges but also benefit
many others facing similar challenges as demonstrated by Case 1 learning to
help Case 2. 

2) "Guided patient driven learning by patients under supervision of their
academic institutional caregivers" can generate participant empathy and
collaboration toward mutual well being.

Above is a work in progress and we need to watch this space. 

Lifestyle choices 2:

Nutrition and physical exercise :

Current challenges identified in both the patients:

Lack of information : 

What has been their diet and exercise levels till date and what has changed
since pharmacological interventions began? 

If their diet and exercise is suboptimal what are the factors responsible for
it? 

Definitive lifestyle interventions instituted :

Positive psychosocial gainful workflow along with proper nutrition and exercise
with adequate monitoring of metabolic parameters and regular positive
feedback. 

Image based monitoring of patient nutrition where patient is asked to share an
image of the pre and post meal plate regularly and offered feedback on the
nutritional value of the plate consumed and suggested changes based on the
nutrition image of the plate intake shared.
