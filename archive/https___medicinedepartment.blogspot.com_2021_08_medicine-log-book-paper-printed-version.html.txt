ethical logbook sharing protocol ****

To our patients and students locally as well as globally

Foreword:
Log Book is a tool toward daily student reflective logging of their learning
experiences and sharing them with peer learners for further feedback driven
learning. 

It was recognized by William Osler in his writings and to quote, 

"Carry a small note-book, and never ask a new patient a question without note-
book and pencil in hand . . . Begin early to make a three-fold category – clear
cases, doubtful cases and
mistakes and learn to play the game fair, no self-deception, no shrinking from
the truth; mercy and consideration for the
other man, but none for yourself, upon whom you have to keep an incessant
watch. It is only by getting your cases
grouped in this way that you can make any real progress in your postcollegiate
education; only in this way you gain
wisdom with experience. (Ref below) 

More than 100 years later, the log book has been considerably tech enhanced in
it's ability to derive global inputs in a weblogged format and the weblog has
become so popular that it is now fondly known as "blog" for short. 

This book published by the institution and our department  is a guide toward
making a good log book write up using selected guidance logs from our past
illustrious students to enable newbies in their medicine  learning journey. We
hope this will be useful.

Student statement :

"This is a paper based  log book (with a corresponding E log version online) to
discuss our patients de-identified health data, shared after taking his/her/
guardian’s signed informed consent (check out the multilingual informed consent
form template in the subsequent pages ahead). Here we discuss our individual
patient’s problems through series of inputs from available local and global
online community of learners and teachers with an aim to solve these patient’s
clinical problems with collective current best evidence based inputs. This log
book also reflects my patient-centered learning portfolio, also available as an
online learning portfolio and your valuable peer review  inputs will enable me
to learn further as to help our patients better.

***** Global patient privacy and confidentiality policies  *****
Global policies are based on global data protection laws and common laws of
confidentiality. Most of the write up here is quoted and borrowed from BMJ's
stance published here: https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/forms-
policies-and-checklists/patient-confidentiality
• Any report/article that contains personal medical information about an
identifiable living individual requires the patient's explicit consent before
it can be shared open access publicly. We will need the patient to sign a
consent form, which requires the patient to have read the article. The consent
form is available in multiple languages and the author must ensure that the
form is in a language that the patient understands.
• If consent cannot be obtained because the patient cannot be traced, then
publication/logging toward sharing will be possible only if the information can
be sufficiently anonymised. Anonymisation means that neither the patient nor
anyone else could identify the patient. A consequence of any anonymisation is
likely to be the loss of information/evidence. If this happens we will include
the following note at the end of the paper: "Detail has been removed from this
case description/these case descriptions to ensure anonymity. The authors/
loggers are satisfied that the information shared here backs up the case the
authors are making." Such anonymisation might, at an extreme, involve making
the authors of the article anonymous.
• If the patient is dead, global data protection laws may not apply, but the
authors should seek permission from a relative (as a matter of courtesy and
medical ethics). If the relatives are not contactable the author/logger needs
to balance the worthwhileness of the case, the likelihood of identification,
and the likelihood of causing offence if identified, in making a decision on
whether we should publish without a relative’s consent. 
• Children- Parents or guardians can consent on their behalf but children aged
between 7 and 18 must also sign the consent form in addition to the parent or
guardian. For younger children, even if parents consent, authors should
consider whether the child, when older, might regret publication of his or her
identifiable details.
• Patients who lack capacity - If the patient lacks the mental capacity to make
a decision about publication then usually no one can give consent on behalf of
the patient. Even if someone has this power, by means, for example of a health
and welfare power of attorney, it has to be exercised in the best interests of
the patient
