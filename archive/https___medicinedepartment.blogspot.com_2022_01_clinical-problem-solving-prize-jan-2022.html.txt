**** Clinical problem solving Prize Jan 2022 monthly assessment paper (Online
assignment) ****
Introduction :

This month's and year's first assessment paper assignment is also focused on
the idea of rewarding our regular trainees around the occasion of our annual
"clinical problem solving" conference.

Our formal training program in "clinical problem solving" is also a mandatory
requirement for passing the final summative assessments (aka MBBS and MD exams)
toward a licence to practice medicine and this year we have already nominated a
few potential prize winning contributions in clinical problem solving from
2020-21 similar to the samples here :  https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/
2022/01/sample-clinical-problem-solving-logs.html?m=1, which have been chosen
from around 1000 "clinical problem solving" submissions hosted in the "online
learning portfolios" of all our trainees accessible full text here : http://
medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/07/?m=0

The clinical problem solving awards are given on the basis of the trainees
overall performance reflected in their E log links representing their "online
learning portfolios," containing their "clinical problem solving" contributions
either in their daily patient centered case reports as well as their
submissions to  monthly online assignments such as this one. 

Answer all questions:                                                      
                    Max Marks: 100 (5 questions in total
                    and 20 marks for each  answer) 
                    Submit by:   20/01/2022              
                    Please be original and refrain from
                    plagiarism. Please note that every
                    logged answer paper should contain the
                    link to this current "assignment/
                    question paper" page and the patient
                    context for each answer. Also share the
                    detailed online links to every quote or
                    reference cited in your answer. 


                    Questions plan and context:
All "clinical problem solving" questions are around student driven patient
centered case reports prepared by our students from our real but deidentified
patients. 

Please review one E logged case report link around the cases that are going to
be presented in the upcoming Jan 25th 2022 clinical problem solving conference
already shared full text by the speakers here : http://
medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/12/medicine-conference-on-theme-
clinical.html?m=1


Q1) Please go through one of  the case reports in the conference link shared
above and provide your critical appraisal of the captured data in terms of
completeness, correctness and ability to provide useful leads to analyze the
diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties around the cases shared.


Q2: Please analyze the linked case report current patient data by first
preparing a problem list for each patient in order of perceived priority (based
on the shared data) and then discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty
around solving those problems. 

Q3) Include the review of literature around sensitivity and specificity of the
diagnostic interventions mentioned and same around efficacy of the therapeutic
interventions mentioned for each patient and suggest innovative solutions
(mentioning how one may design an ethical trial to scale the proposed
innovative solution).

Q4) Share the link to your own case report this month of a patient that you
connected with and engaged while capturing his her sequential life events
before and after the illness and clinical and investigational images along with
your discussion of that case. 


Q 5) Please reflect on your patient centered experiences that you had while
solving their problems this month. 

A sample answer to this last assignment around sharing your experience log of
the month can be seen in one student's  answer to Q10 in the  May 2021
