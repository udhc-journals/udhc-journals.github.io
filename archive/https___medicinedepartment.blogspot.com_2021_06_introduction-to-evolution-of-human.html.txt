**** Introduction to evolution of human language, communication and scholarship
****
Scholarship is a cognitive endeavor in humans that enables shared learning
through sharing of human experiences and experiments.

Ever since human evolution, communication has fostered learning and a major
breakthrough in human communication happened in our cave dwelling ancestors
thousands of years ago when they learned to code, initially using their vocal
cords and tongue and palate to produce repetitive syntactical  sounds that
could be replicated between humans to create meaning aka semantics. 

Kids globally and since time immemorial are hardwired to learn high level
coding from the age of one and 99% of them do it very well as long as they can
hear their parents or primary care givers speak. 

Using vocal cords to code and witness output functions as soon as they run a
vibration on their vocal cords is innate in most kids who quickly learn to use
coding aka language to navigate their world when they notice the vibration "da-
da" brings in a moustached gentleman running at their beck and command while
"ma-ma" brings a clean shaven person who satisfies their hunger and also makes
the moustached man run around with commands. 

The next step in learning to code is at the age of 3-4 when they are introduced
to hieroglyphs that become alphabets and code syntax when the audio visual
"apple" becomes a syntax "a". 


Other than the evolution of language described above, the next major
breakthrough in human cognition and communication was the development of
asynchronous learning when our cave dwelling ancestors would log their daily
events, experiences and experiments along with current location  using paint on
their cave walls and the written alphabet was born. The journal space is a
legacy of that period which has evolved from papyrus to print and finally into
an electronic space shared globally in the cloud. 
Scholarship is an expression of this asynchronous communication utilizing the
tools of reading and writing that are symbolic ways to transfer information to
a large human audience without having to meet them face to face at the same
time and was exemplified in early human history through letter writing as soon
as humans made the transition from cave dwelling animals to using papyrus. 

Scholarship has evolved from the above humble beginnings of asynchronous
communication in our cave dwelling ancestors to the current complex expressions
in various media and yet remains at it's core a usage model of symbolic
communication to transmit insights from one human to many.
