Standard letter of recommendation LOR template:

September 30th, 2020

Dear Program Director,

    I am pleased to write a letter of reference for Ms. _________ in her
application for residency. I’ve had the pleasure of guiding Ms. _____ for the
past four years. She completed two-month General Medicine rotations, every
year, during her clinical years in medical school training, at PQRS Hospital,
India. During that time, she was responsible for managing patients by taking
patient history, conducting complete clinical examinations, calling in
consults, reviewing lab reports, and monitoring patient care. Ms. _____ carried
out these responsibilities with diligence and skill. She also attended various
academic sessions and actively participated in daily rounds.

    I can strongly attest to Ms. ______ abilities as I’ve had the opportunity
to oversee her in both the In-patient and Out-patient setting, taught her in
class and worked with her during internship. She has gained experience in
diagnosing and managing common medical conditions such as, Diabetes,
Hypertension, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, COPD, Stroke, poisonings and various
infectious diseases. She has performed procedures such as pleural and ascitic
tap, central line catheterizations, endotracheal intubation and local nerve
block administration. She is also well practiced in procedures such as
nasogastric tube insertions, IV-line insertions, Foley’s catheterization and
drawing arterial and venous blood samples. She had taken the initiative to
present various topics such as, ‘Epilepsy’ and Rheumatic Fever’ and actively
participated in their discussions during academic sessions. Her enthusiasm to
learn, team attitude, and professional work ethic was well appreciated, and she
had hence been described as one of the best students on our team by our
residents and attending physician.

    Apart from Ms. ______ impressive list of attributes, one well-appreciated
trait is her willingness to take initiative. An example of such an instance was
during her internship year, when due to unforeseen circumstances, a Health Camp
had to be organised last minute. Ms. ____ was one of the few interns who
volunteered to attend this Health Camp immediately after completing a night
shift at the hospital. She spent the day taking history and examining over 100
patients of a homeless shelter for the mentally ill. Her dedication and passion
for Medicine was apparent in her work ethic.

    Ms. ______ has a sound knowledge of general medicine and its various
disciplines. In addition, she is hardworking and highly motivated with a good
sense of ethics and responsibility. Her communication skills and the respect
she demonstrated towards patients, staff and colleagues were impressive. I am
confident of her capability of working in a team effectively and efficiently,
as she had demonstrated good leadership on multiple occasions. Ms. _____ is a
well-rounded and promising student whom I have no hesitation in recommending
for your residency program. If you have any further questions regarding Ms.
_____ or my experience with her, please do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,


Dr. Xyz, MD
Professor & HOD of General Medicine
