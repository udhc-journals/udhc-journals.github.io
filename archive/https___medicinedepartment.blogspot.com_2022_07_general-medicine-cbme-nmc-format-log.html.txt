Singh, Tejinder & Aulakh, Roosy & Gupta, Priyanka & Chhatwal, Jugesh & Gupta, Piyush. (2021). Logbook for Pediatrics: Under-graduate competency-based curriculum of NMC. 10.13140/RG.2.2.18176.97287/1. Full text downloadable from : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/

1. This logbook is a record of academic and other activities of the student in the Department of Pediatrics. 2. Entries in the logbook reflect the activities undertaken by the student and certified by the faculty. 3. The student would be responsible for maintaining his/her logbook
regularly. 4. The student is responsible for getting the logbook entries verified by concerned faculty regularly. 5. The logbook should be verified by the Head of Department before forwarding the application of the student for the University Examination. 6. The reflections should
demonstrate the learning that has taken place. Don’t simply repeat the activities performed. Emphasize the learning experience, what you learnt and how it is going to be useful in future. At times, mistakes also provide great learning opportunities. Reflections provide a useful opportunity
to document and assess learning for many competencies where there is no formal assessment. A deliberate effort should be made to teach the students to write academically useful reflections. Similarly, the teachers should acquire the skills for assessing reflections. 7. Using an electronic
version of this logbook to facilitate documentation and retrieval of the work, is highly recommended and approximately 1000 such E log books starting from batch 2015 are available here :

SECTION - A
Competencies in General Medicine

Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME) curriculum in General Medicine

More than 1000 competencies have been listed in General Medicine" under knowledge, skills, attitude and communication, rather meticulously and exhaustively in the NMC website  here : https://www.nmc.org.in/information-desk/for-colleges/ug-curriculum/ (check out the freely downloadable PDF
marked as UG curriculum vol II also downloadable from here : https://www.nmc.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UG-Curriculum-Vol-II.pdf)

CLINICAL CASE PRESENTATIONS :

The department encpurages all their students to document all their clinical case presentations in  separate E logged case reports (appropriately deidentified and after signed informed consent from the patient),  with evidence of their verbal competencies in clinical problem solving and non
verbal procedural videos reflecting their body language toward communication skills as well as certifiable procedural competencies. 
All these are archived and displayed here :http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2022/02/?m=0
for five batches starting from 2015  amounting to approximately 5000 case reports (and growing everyday) 

REFLECTIONS: CLINICAL CASE PRESENTATION

(Students should preferably reflect on cases which they themselves have presented and focus on :

What happened?

So what?

What next?
