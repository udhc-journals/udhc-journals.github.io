Effect of early treatment with fluvoxamine on risk of emergency care and
hospitalisation among patients with COVID-19: the TOGETHER randomised, platform
clinical trial.
Lancet Glob Health. 2021; (published online Oct 27.)

fulltext

main study limitations are related to the lack of event adjudication and to the
inconclusive effects on patient-important outcomes such as hospitalisation and
mortality. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X
(21)00501-5/fulltext

Our take : 

 PICO 

"P" outpatients with laboratory-documented SARS-CoV-2

"I" Fluvoxamine (n=741) 

"C" placebo (n=756)

"O" the fluvoxamine group 79 (11%) participants had a primary outcome event
compared with 119 (16%) in the placebo group (table_2). Most events (87%) were
hospitalisations.

the minor differences between hospitalization could be the anxiolytic effect of
fluvoxamine.
