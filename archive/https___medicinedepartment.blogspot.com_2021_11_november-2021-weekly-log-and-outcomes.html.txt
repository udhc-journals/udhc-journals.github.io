**** November 2021 weekly log and outcomes of regular patient centered learning
sessions ****
This is a regular academic session impact assessment log for the post graduate
residency training program comprising currently of residents of 2019 and 2020
batch. 

The training program comprises of a regular hands on learning of clinical
decision making during the bedside rounds from 10 AM to 1:00 PM as well as 2-
4 sessions officially divided daily into:

Theory on Monday, 

Seminar on Tuesday, 

Journal club on Wednesday, 

Tutorial on Thursday 

Group discussion on Friday 

Log Book audit on Saturday 

These are blended learning sessions with both online and offline components and
while the offline learning timings are as mentioned above, the online component
of the learning continues 24x7.

The overall impact of each learning session is assessed under two main headings
as impact on the student and impact on patient. 

The detailed headings are :


Impact : 

On learning ecosystem :

Cognitive competency levels touched in different levels of Blooms taxonomy BT
(more here : https://sites.pitt.edu/~super1/lecture/lec54091/002.htm):

Approach to disease localization (BT level 1 -3)

Resolving initial diagnostic uncertainty (BT level 1-4)

Therapeutic decision making toward evaluating patient requirements and outcome
(BT level 1-5)

Developing and testing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic solutions ( BT
level 1-6)

On patient care outcomes :

Was empathic trust built with patient and relatives?

Were the patient requirements identified adequately and a proper problem list
made toward assessment? 

Was standard of care provided with provision for care continuity ?

them aware that their rare disease has been described before (initially
globally in 1987) and available solutions identified although in terms of
therapeutic outcomes not much was achieved except reducing overinvestigations
and overtreatment of an hitherto unknown PUO.

Wednesday 

Journal club 2-4 PM 

Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction .
RCT - placebo control trial .

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911303.

P- Total 4744 patients with HFref .
2373- Dapagliflozin 10mg od .
2371 - placebo

I- Dapagliflozin vs placebo

C- Placebo 

O - The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure
(hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart
failure) or cardiovascular death.
1) 237 - In dapaglifozin grp had worsening heart failure and 227- Died.
2) 326- placebo had worsening HF
273- DIED .

CONCLUSION : 

Among patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, the risk of
worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes was lower among
those who received dapagliflozin than among those who received placebo,
regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

But pts who were included , dapagliflozon had more patients with NYHA class 2
 and placebo had more pts with NYHA class 3,4 HF . Which can explain frequent
hospital admissions in them .

Presenter Dr KV

Journal club 

In this context:  http://elogformedicalcase.blogspot.com/2021/11/recurrent-
seizures-activity.html, the journal club for today required browsing through
quite a few articles such as these here 👇

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173734/

And these https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33822427/

And a typical journal club RCT article with ridiculous efficacy such as this
one 

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2762700

Second Article and context :

50 patients presenting to the hospital with peritonitis. 

39 of them had typical infectious peritonitis, and their mean peritoneal fluid
amylase level was 11.1 (range, 0 to 90). 

6 patients had pancreatitis and a mean peritoneal fluid amylase level of 550 U/
L (range, 100 to 1,140 U/L). 

5 patients were found to have other intra-abdominal pathology, and their mean
peritoneal fluid amylase level was 816 U/L (range, 142 to 1,746 U/L).

Presenters : Dr Vaishnavi, Dr Nikita, Dr Pooja (intern) and Dr (Soujanya 2017)


Impact : 

On learning ecosystem :

Cognitive competency levels touched :

Approach to clinical localization of disease pathology was done reasonably well
and differential diagnostic hypothesis formulated in the face of high
diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty 

On patient care outcomes :

Empathic trust built with patient and relatives 

Standard of care provided with provision for care continuity  

Challenges met/not met : 

Fever monitoring and post admission illness timeline was well supervised. 

Imaging and labs for further  clinical localization of the PUO was driven by
the discussion 

Multiple therapeutic interventions were made for the differentials in the face
of diagnostic uncertainty further driven by ongoing patient suffering and an
attempt to gather the "medical cognition" learning points made here :

Group discussion on Friday  26th

Detection of Rifampicin resistance by gene probe assay(CBNAAT)

95% of mutations associated with rifampin resistance occur in an 81-bp core
region of the bacterial RNA polymerase gene, rpoB. (enzyme involved in
synthesis of target site of Rifampicin)

All mutations that occur within this region result in rifampin resistance. 
The assay uses novel nucleic acid hybridization probes called molecular
beacons. 

Five different probes are used in the same reaction, each perfectly
complementary to a different target sequence within the rpoB gene of rifampin-
susceptible bacilli and each labeled with a differently colored fluorophore.
Together, their target sequences encompass the entire core region. 

The generation of all five fluorescent colors during PCR amplification
indicates that rifampin-susceptible M. tuberculosis is present. 

The presence of any mutation in the core region prevents the binding of one of
the molecular beacons, resulting in the absence of one of the five fluorescent
colors
