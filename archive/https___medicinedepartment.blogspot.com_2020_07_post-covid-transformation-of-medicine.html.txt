**** Post covid transformation of medicine summative assessments ****

In the current context one of the ways medical education and practice is
insidiously or perhaps even dramatically being changed is through this new wave
of virtual assessments as per the addendum to the MCI recommendations being
circulated that encourages faculty to evaluate students using virtual patients
rather than visit the bedside of real patients. 

Our interns have created a repository or sort of a question bank of virtual
cases as shared earlier here https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/07/
virtual-clinical-long-and-short-cases.html?m=1 and we would be currently taking
both the UG and PG exams in the traditional format offline as available here 

UG: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlY57unJW-
ZpFmwuZrfbvmsroaFTUVCmEWZrsB_Gz6I/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=106211649452385508461

PG:https://docs.google.com/document/d/

using our virtual case bank for each candidate. We may even take them through
an online webex call as demonstrated in this linked video where we were taking
the MBBS pre final today.

However if I had a choice I would do it very differently from the traditional
format which is quite dated (maybe five decades allegedly). 

This is the link to my competency based assessment format here https://

edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=106211649452385508461

And our daily workflow described here https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/
2020/06/daily-workflow-of-our-case-based.html?m=1 goes some way to achieve
this. 

Also would like to incorporate live telemedical cases instead of just static
virtual cases as previously described here
