The above cases were also read out as a synchronous presentation along with
answering of questions from online and offline examiners (as a part of a
university summative assessment). The questions were directed to assess the
presenter's competency in diagnosing and treating the above cases and is video
linked there in the above two links for each of the hundreds of cases by
hundreds of students. 

Weekly assignment:

1) Please go through the long and short cases, one at a time in the links
shared above and provide your critical appraisal of the captured data in terms
of completeness, correctness and ability to provide useful leads to analyze the
diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties around the cases shared.

Please provide your peer review assessment on not only the the student's
written case report but also the reading of the cases followed by the question
answer session linked above in the video and share your thoughts around each
answer by the student along with your qualitative insights into what was good
or bad about the answer. 


2: Testing scholarship competency of the examinees ( ability to read
comprehend, analyze, reflect upon and discuss captured patient centered data):

Please analyze the above linked long and short cases patient data by first
preparing a problem list for each patient in order of perceived priority (based
on the shared data) and then discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty
around solving those problems. 

3)Testing competency in "Evidence based medicine": 
Include the review of literature around sensitivity and specificity of the
diagnostic interventions mentioned and same around efficacy of the therapeutic
interventions mentioned for each patient. 

4) Testing competency in patient data capture and representation through
ethical case reporting/case presentation with informed consent :

Share the link to your own case report this month of a patient that you
connected with and engaged while capturing his her sequential life events
before and after the illness and clinical and investigational images along with
your discussion of that case. 


Q 5) Testing scholarship competency in  
logging reflective observations on your concrete experiences of this last month
:  

Reflective logging  of one's own experiences is a vital tool toward competency
development in medical education and research. 

A few sample write ups on this last assignment around sharing your experience
log of the month can be seen in one student's  answer to Q10 in the  May 2021
assignment in the link below:
