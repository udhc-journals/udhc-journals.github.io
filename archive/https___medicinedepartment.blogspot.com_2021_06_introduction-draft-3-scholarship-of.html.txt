**** Introduction, Draft 3 Scholarship of Integration and the future of Medical
education and research ****
 (A) 
(A)ssessed Need for the chapter in the context of medical education research,
practice, publication, or scholarship. Word limit suggested, 400 to 500 words:

Introduction:

For most medical students and teachers medical education begins with their
entry to medical school and begins with an introduction to the dead body and
the this cadaveric teacher bares it's innards for all budding health
professionals to learn the various components of the individual human system
even while they attend parallel classes on physiology and biochemistry to
further learn how this anatomic structure functions in a living human in all
it's fascinating internal molecular and cellular complexity. 

Again in the next year they learn pathology which describes how a body is
structurally ravaged by illness at a cellular and molecular level often
historically unravelled after death. Finally they are introduced to the whole
alive human being in their later clinical years where they learn to apply the
knowledge of yester years to a living complex human being with his her complex
network of problems rooted either in his her environment or genes. 

However this was not always how medicine was historically learned and this
current curricular methodology of putting dry factual content before the
student gets to experience learning in the context of the entire human,
undermines the very ethos of medical education which is essentially to help
health professionals improve patient care outcomes. 
Consequently one main problem statement theme for this chapter is the current
"disintegration of Medical education with practice" and the tool that it aims
to resolve the problem with is scholarly integration of Medical education and
research. 
The other problem that this chapter addresses with the same tool is the current
issue of national medical  integration, which has reached a tipping point due
to a reigining covid chaos that has fast tracked all diverse interventions with
varying methodological backgrounds into battling one single disease. 
Very few people know what is "scholarship of Integration in medical education
and research" and how it can be a tool to tackle the current problems in
medical education and practice and one important need this chapter will address
is to fill in that information gap. 
Very few people realize that Medical education research is a tool to eventually
improve patient outcomes as patient is the ultimate beneficiary of Medical
education and this chapter will again not only address this vital information
gap but become instrumental in driving positive change in this direction. 
Scholarship of integration in Medical education and research : what it is and
what it isnt:
Scholarship of integration in medical education and research makes connections
within and between disciplines, locating knowledge in a broader context giving
meaning to specific discoveries. It aims to distribute the fruits of academic
discovery to benefit specific individual members of society aka patients who in
turn help academics to multiply the construction of new knowledge translated
into practice. (Reference: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1891293/
#!po=75.3968)

It is vital that academic institutions and medical schools remain relevant in
an era when the production of knowledge is increasingly recognized as a social
collaborative activity. 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1891293/ )
In this article we address two important problems and it's subcategories with
the tool of scholarly integration namely 
primarily around two broad categories and it's subcategories:

a) Current disintegration of Medical education and practice 

Medical student and faculty engagement in rote memorization through an arcane
curriculum that promotes plagiarism and diminishes scholarship 

disconnected from 

Patients who continue to suffer due to lack of student and faculty engagement
with them in a broader empathic meaningful manner. 

b) Long overdue National Medical integration of health care delivery through
methodologically diverse streams of interventions:

India's traditional and tribal system of Medicine historically neglected due to
undue hype created by a dominant Western mode of Medical education that engages
our students and teachers as unquestioning slaves.

Although current West has moved on globally, we are unable to get over our
colonial past that continues to haunt our education and practice. 

Our proposed tool of scholarly integration, enables shared knowledge through a
participatory framework and includes practical methods to guide institutional
change along with reporting and evaluating them.  
At the outset one must clarify that scholarship of integration is not the same
as scholarship of teaching and learning aka SOTL and borrowing from an
excellent recent editorial (Singh T, Gupta P, Can We Consider Scholarship of
Teaching Learning Rather than Focusing Only on publications for Recognition of
Medical teachers by National Medical Commission? Annals of the National Academy
of Medical Sciences (India) 2021; 57(01): 01-02 DOI: 10.1055/s-0041-1728179) ,
SOTL as identified by Felten13 thrives on  five principles: 
(1) inquiry focused on student learning, 
(2) grounded in context, 
(3) methodologically sound, 
(4) conducted in partnership with students, and (
5) appropriately public. (Felten P. Principles of good practice in SoTL.
Teaching and Learning Inquiry 2013;1(1):121–125).
TS et al's editorial contributes very interesting questions. 

"How such a scholarship can be evaluated? Should it focus on output or
outcome?"

The answer to the first would be open access self publication in one's own
online learning portfolio such as even an online question paper designed can be
shared for evaluation among  peers as here: http://
medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/05/online-blended-bimonthly-
assignment.html?m=1

The above link to our online test for the month of May 2021 is essentially a
student user driven, real patient centered, experiential sharing of individual
patient data in the form of patient centered questions for solving and helping
those individuals.

The competencies tested are the usual (mentioned in the link above) although
unlike last month it doesn't test the competencies for familiarity with
Empathy, Humanities and ML AI. 

Q10 looks at another topical area and that is "medical education" itself where
students are also encouraged to think about their learning process. 

The answer to the second would surely be outcomes but not just on student
learning but also in the context of Medical education directed toward it's
 ultimate beneficiaries, that is the patients themselves, through a framework
that enables driving of patient outcomes through student learning outcomes and
a real time clinical audit trail that allows us to join the dots between the
two. 

The above would bring us closer to scholarship of integration in Medical
education and research which is not just about integrating scholarship of
teaching learning with the scholarship of discovery but is all about
integration of patient centered societal goals with teaching and learning.
