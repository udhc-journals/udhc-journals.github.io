**** Medicine learning competencies through a USMLE LOR lens 2 ****
Dear Program Director,

It is with great pleasure that I endorse Dr. ______, one of our very bright
students, for your Internal Medical Residency Program. 

I currently look after the Department of General Medicine at xyz Institute of
Medical Sciences and other than a graduate residency training and undergraduate
program, we also host a global elective learning program supported nominally by
the BMJ group detailed here: https://promotions.bmj.com/jnl/bmj-case-reports-
student-electives-2/

Our department has known ______ since her second year General Medicine
rotations, and she has interacted with us most heavily in her final year
posting in General Medicine. 

As part of her clinical rotations, she was assigned a medical ward and single
handedly managed the case study, care, report follow up, and diagnostic work up
of more than twenty in-patients at a time. One such 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM regular
ward round with students like her is archived here: https://youtu.be/ls-
h6vdW4XU

Her interest in the subject went far beyond the necessary academic requirements
and led to many in-depth discussions in the 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM sessions

During her rotations, she along with her batchmates submitted records
documenting many cases she examined—including Rheumatic heart disease with
valvular defects, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, pleural effusions, and cerebro-
vascular accidents leading to hemiplegia. Many such cases are recorded in the
virtual case bank hosted by the post graduate residents of our department to
which our students and interns regularly contribute and is linked here:https://

Her unit team members report being impressed with her systematic and meticulous
approach to assessing a large caseload, and are certain that she has a strong
aptitude for the internal medicine field. 

______ has undergone intensive training in acute medical care, Basic and
Advanced Life Support, and can handle most medical emergencies efficiently. 

She has imbibed from our department a patient centred approach to medical care,
and shall always makes it her priority to ensure their comfort. 

______ was also an active participant in the pulse polio program among several
other social and welfare activities conducted regularly by our hospital for our
rural outreach population. 

She was even part of a select group of students who wrote up case studies of
patients similar to what has been published by our students here:https://
casereports.bmj.com/content/13/9/e233197.full?ijkey=j97rohET1rNJeZm&keytype=ref

I am confident that her strong subject foundation and passion towards the
profession will make her an irreplaceable addition to the medical community and
I whole-heartedly recommend ______ as an excellent candidate for your Internal
Medical Residency Program. 

best regards,
