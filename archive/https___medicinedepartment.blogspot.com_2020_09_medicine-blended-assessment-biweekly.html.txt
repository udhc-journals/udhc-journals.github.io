available in the patient's online record linked above? (ignore the provisional
diagnosis on admission mentioned in the case report)

2) What are the reasons for her:

Azotemia 

Anemia 

Hypoalbuminemia 

Acidosis 

3) What was the rationale for her treatment plan detailed day wise in the
record? 

Particularly mention rationale and  efficacy for some of the drugs administered
such as oral and iv bicarbonate? When is iv or oral bicarbonate indicated and
why is it contraindicated in certain situations? 

4) What was the indication for dialysing her and what was the crucial factor
that led to the decision to dialyze her on the third day of admission?

her current condition? 

6) What are the expected outcomes in this patient? Compare the outcomes of
similar patients globally and share your summary with reference links.

are the mechanisms of HFpEF in diabetic renal failure patients?

8) What are the efficacies over placebo for the available therapeutic options
being provided to her for her anemia? 

What is the utility of tools like the CKD-AQ that assess the frequency,
severity, and impact on daily activities of symptoms of anemia of CKD? Is

metabolic acidosis and hypoalbuminemia logged by intern Dr Bhavya here https://

Please comment on the differences in the diagnosis, therapy and outcomes in
both these two patients. 

Would you agree with the provisional diagnosis shared for this  58 M in the
online case report linked above?

What are the findings in the ultrasound of both kidneys? How do you explain
those findings? Would it explain the etiology for his renal failure?

questions but take care not to plagiarise any of that literature while
