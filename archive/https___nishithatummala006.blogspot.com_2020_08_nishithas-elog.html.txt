This is an online E log book to discuss our patient's de-identified health data
shared after taking his/her/guardian's signed informed consent. 

Here we discuss our individual patient's problems through series of inputs from
available global online community of experts with an aim to solve those
patient's clinical problems with collective current best evidence based
inputs. 

This E log book also reflects my patient-centered online learning portfolio and
your valuable inputs on the comment box is welcome.



Here is a case i have seen:



A 22 year old man  presented with the chief complaint of generalized edema
since 2 weeks. 

The youngest of 4 and working as a cashier patient reported to work as usual 2
weeks ago, when his friends asked if he overslept and developed a puffy face.
Puzzled, the patient immediately saw himself in the mirror and noticed that he
had periorbital edema under both eyes. He did not have any rash, lip swelling
or difficulty in chewing or pain in jaws at that point. No history of wheeze or
pain abdomen at that point. He said that after a few hours of work, the edema
subsided spontaneously and the same sequence of events happend for the next 2
days. Sensing some problem, the patient quit work and returned to his hometown.
The next day he noticed that he also started developing pedal edema, initially
in the left ankle and gradually becoming bilateral. The edema progressively
increased upto his knees over 3 days. He later developed distension of abdomen
which was associated with early satiety. He denied constipation, vomiting, pain
abdomen or fever. Distressed, the patient sought help with a local practitioner
who prescribed a myriad of drugs, which he says did not do much to relieve his
symptoms. A few days later, the patient also noticed that he was becoming
breathless with minimal exertion. He says he couldn't even walk for a few yards
before becoming breathless. He denied palpitations, syncope or presyncope,
chest pain, cough or expectoration. He reported fatigue since the last 5 days. 

He denies a history of sore throat, skin lesions, blurring of vision or pain in
the eyes, no history of hemoptysis, upper respiratory tract symptoms or
allergic symptoms. No history of night sweats or weight loss either. No history
of dysuria or hematuria. He reports he had been having foamy urine for the past
2 weeks. No decreased urine output. 

The patient's drug history is significant for using Nitrofurantoin for 1 week.
 He denies any recreational drug use or abuse. He denies previous sexual
activity. No history of exposure to pets or domesticated animals. His past
medical history is significant for Chickenpox at age of 12

The patient is keenly interested in knowing about his problem and wants a quick
resolution so that he can get back

PROBLEM REPRESENTATION

A 22 yr old previously healthy man presented with Anasarca, foamy urine and
progressive shortness of breath since 2 weeks
On examination he appeared mildly tachypneic at rest with pedal edema, ascites
and pleural effusion. Laboratory investigations revealed a spot protein
creatinine ratio of 10.7 and a mild hyponatremia at 131 meqs/L. A renal biopsy
is planned and he is currently on diuretic therapy to relieve edema.

SOAP notes on 4/08/2020 

22M with Nephrotic Syndrome

S - Feeling the same breathlessness (on leaving bed and going to washroom).
Periorbital edema and pedal edema increased

O - Mildly tachypneic at rest with RR at 24. PR 97bpm and Spo2 98% on ambient
air. He is afebrile with a BP of 100/70. Stony dull note with decreased to no
breath sounds increased on both sides. Weight 64kgs (1 kilo increase).

A - Anasarca increasing. Pleural effusion has increased (clinically).
Inadequate diuresis

P - Will require aggresive diuresis. Renal biopsy opinion today. A repeat Chest
Xray and Serum albumin to gauge progress.
 
SOAP on 5/08/2020

22M with. Nephrotic Syndrome

S - Patient reports resolution of breathlessness. Distension of abdomen
decreased. He reports some improvement in overall functional capacity. 

O - BP at 120/90. PR at 90. RR at 18 and Spo2 on ambient air 98. Weight 60kgs

A - Patient did not reach adequate diuresis target today. He is currently on
dual diuretics which needs to be gauged for their potency tomorrow. He also
received Lasix and Albumin today at 4 pm. 

P - Renal biopsy still the definitive investigation. Diuresis and target body
weight likely to be reached in 2 days.



TREATMENT GIVEN
1)inj lasix 40 mg iv bd
2)inj optineuron 1 amp 100 ml NS iv over. 30 min
3)tab pantop 40 mg od
4) salt restriction diet < 4 mg
5)inj albumin 20% 100ml iv over 45min from 4/08/2020
6)inj metolazone 2.5 BD from 5/08/2020
7) tab telmisartan 40 mg OD on 6/08/2020

DIAGNOSIS

NEPHROTIC SYNDROME for evaluation 

DISCUSSION 

COHORT STUDY showing histological type of nephrotic syndrome 

Adult patients aged above 12  years with nephrotic range proteinuria  and
disclosing no secondary  causes for nephrotic syndrome were included in  this
study.  Age, gender,  duration and degree of proteinuria,  hematuria, oliguria,
hypertension, edema, pleural effusion, ascites, hemoglobin,  total and
differential count, urine albumin, urine sediment, 24-h urinary  protein, renal
function tests, serum cholesterol, serum albumin and  ultrasound of the abdomen
of these patients were studied.  
We studied  86 patients who underwent renal biopsy  in  the  nephrology  unit
of  our  hospital. Among them, 65 were found to  have nephrotic syndrome  and
50 met the selection criteria for this study.  The mean age  of the patients
was 34 ±  14.7  years, and 35 (70%) were  males. The histological subtypes
 found  in  our patients included  minimal change  disease (MCNS) [11 (22%)
patients], focal segmental glomerulosclerosis  (FSGS) (23 [46%]  patients) and
membranous glomerulonephritis (MN)  [16 (46%) patients]. 

Macrohematuria was revealed in five out of a total of  50 patients, and the
majority  of the patients (80%) gave a history of passing frothy  urine. The
pattern of distribution  of hypertension among the histological subtypes did
 not show significant differences. A key point we are getting here is -
Hematuria can also occur in Nephrotic syndromes and also Hypertension can also
occur in Nephrotic Syndromes. Again, textbook learning gone with the wind 🏁 

Three of the  11 cases of  MCNS, seven of the 23 cases of FSGS and four of the
 16 cases of MN had hypertension. There  were 23  (46%) patients who  had
ascites at  the time of presentation; 15 of 23 (65%) cases  of FSGS had
ascites, four  of 11 cases had MCNS and four of 16 cases had MN. Microhematuria
was revealed in 13  out of  50 (26%) patients in this study;  11/13  of them
had FSGS and 2/13 cases had MN.
Severe hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <2.5 g/dL) was observed in 34  of 50
(68%) cases;  seven of 11 cases of MCNS, 11 of 16 cases of MN and  16  of 23
cases of FSGS had severe hypoalbuminemia.

This is a Keralite study so I think the patient characteristics in this study
could match our patient's.

1)Anatomical diagnosis -? Glomerulus of kidney                                
                                   Etiological diagnosis -  ?? Nephrotic
syndrome secondary to the diabetic nephropathy or CKD.      2)Reasons for I)
Azotemia : impaired renal excretion of urea and creatinine secondary to CKD.
 II) Anemia : decreased erythropoietin.  III) Hypoalbunemia: capillary basement

of metabolic acidosis ..Insulin and antihypertensives are given because known
case of DM and HTN. Orofer XT was given because of anemia.. Inj. Lasix was
