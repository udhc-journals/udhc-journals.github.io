 _January_19,_2022_

For this year’s clinical problem-solving conference, I have chosen the case on
neurodegenerative diseases.
This is the link to the semi-structured case:  A_58_year_old_man_with
unexplanied_dementia,_slurring_of_speech_and_urinary_incontinence_since_6
months_and_forgetfulness_since_3_months_(jabeenahmed300.blogspot.com)
In this ELog, I have attempted to answer the following questions:
   1. What is the timeline of symptoms seen in this patient? What is the
      mechanism of the symptoms?
   2. What are the currently approved treatments for this condition?
   3. What are the future prospects in the treatment of this condition?
QUESTION_1:_Timeline_and_Mechanism_of_Symptoms
[https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/

The timeline and progression of the symptoms is indicative of Alzheimer's
Disease. 
A. Slurred speech and  Delay in response to commands: This is seen when the
temporal lobe (specifically the language processing and speech centres) begin
to deteriorate. 
B. Apathy: This could be due to the disease spreading to the anterior cingulate
cortex 
                     
          "Apathy in AD is associated with gray matter atrophy in the
          anterior cingulate cortex and the left supplementary motor
          area
          People with AD and apathy also have more white matter
          hyperintensities and a mixed pattern of reduced and
          elevated blood flow in different regions, thereby
          suggesting that the brain may be trying to compensate for
          the reduced blood flow. People with dementia and apathy
          also show a blunted response to d-amphetamine, suggesting
          problems with the brain reward system"
 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3299979/
      
      C. Hallucinations, Sleep disturbances, Memory loss: These are common
symptoms in middle-to-late stage AD.  Memory loss, specifically, has been
hypothesized to be caused by the decline of MTL function.
         "As the disease progresses, delusions, hallucinations, and
     aggression become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent
     and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. Additionally,
     circadian sleep-wake rhythms become exaggerated as compared with the
     phase shifts associated with normal aging."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3299979/ 
      
     "Memory impairments appear to be significantly correlated with medial
     temporal lobe atrophy and hypoactivation."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5684784/ 
 
            
       D. Urinary incontinence: The mechanism of this symptom is very unclear.
It could be due to amyloid deposits in the micturition centers of the brain,
causing loss of signal. Urinary incontinence can also be attributed to the
progressing cognitive decline: It is possible that the patient fails to
recognize the need to micturate, or is unable to reach the appropriate place in
time.

       E. Dysphagia: The patient showed aversion to both food and water. 

     "Swallowing disorders of the AD group may result from sensory
     impairment in relation to dysfunctions in the temporoparietal areas,
     whereas the swallowing disorders of VaD group may primarily be caused
     by motor impairments due to disruptions in the corticobulbar
     tract. AD with EPS predominantly shows rigidity and bradykinesia."

QUESTION_2:_Currently_Approved_Treatments
This patient was treated with Donepezil - Cholinesterase inhibitor (10mg/day
which was increased to 20mg/day).
The currently accepted drug treatments for AD include:

1.   Cholinesterase_inhibitors: Efficacy_and_safety_of_rivastigmine_in_patients
with_Alzheimer’s_disease:_international_randomized_controlled_trial_(nih.gov)
 
P – N = 725 – Mild to moderately severe AD
I – with Rivastigmine 243 – High dose, 243 – Low dose
C – 239 placebo
O –Patients taking placebo experienced a decline in cognitive function. 55%
(86/157) of those in the higher dose group improved from baseline measurements
compared with 45% (93/205) of those treated with placebo (analysis of observed
cases).
 
2.   Memantine_(NMDA_receptor_blocker): Memantine_treatment_in_patients_with
moderate_to_severe_Alzheimer_disease_already_receiving_donepezil:_a_randomized
controlled_trial_-_PubMed_(nih.gov)
 
P – 404 patients; Moderate to severe AD
I – 203 with Memantine (20mg/day)
C – 201 with placebo
O –Stable doses of donepezil + memantine resulted in significantly better
outcomes than placebo on measures of cognition, activities of daily living,
global outcome, and behavior and was well tolerated.
 
3.   Suvorexant_(Orexin_receptor_antagonist): Polysomnographic_assessment_of
suvorexant_in_patients_with_probable_Alzheimer's_disease_dementia_and_insomnia:
a_randomized_trial_(nih.gov)
 
P – N= 285; Patients suffering from insomnia in mild-to-moderate Alzheimers
I – 142 with suvorexant
C – 143 with placebo
O –  At week 4, the mean improvement‐from‐baseline in TST was 73 minutes for
suvorexant and 45 minutes for placebo. The number (%) of patients with ≥50
minute improvement in TST at week 4 was 83 (62%) of 135 in the suvorexant group
and 62 (45%) of 139 in the placebo group.

QUESTION_3:_Potential_Drug_Therapies
There have been numerous drug trials targeting different steps in AD pathology.
These include disease-modifying therapies as well as symptomatic therapies. 

                                                                      Source

    1.   BACE_INHIBITORS_AND_GAMMA_SECRETASE_INHIBITORS
 
β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which is thought to be essential for the
production of Aβ peptides. Inhibition of the enzymes that produce the Aβ
peptide from its precursor, amyloid precursor protein (APP) can help prevent
the first step of AD - accumulation of amyloid plaques. BACE inhibitors have
been thought to improve cognitive and functional performance by suppressing Aβ
production. Small molecule BACE inhibitors (Elenbecestat) are being evaluated
in a Phase III study in early AD patients with confirmed brain amyloid using
positron emission tomography (PET) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessment.

                         From_<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov  
 
2.   GAMMA_OSCILLATION
 
Gamma oscillation, a high-frequency brainwave rhythm, is associated with inter-
neuronal communication in virtually all brain networks and may help to
distinguish between true and false memories. Recently, researchers at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that induction of gamma-frequency
oscillations led to reduced Aβ deposition and improved cognitive outcomes in an
AD mouse model.

oscillations distinguish true from false                memories. Psychol Sci.
2007;18(11):927-932. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02003.x
 
3.   BEXAROTENE
 
Bexarotene, an anticancer drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, selectively targets the primary nucleation step in Aβ42
aggregation. It delays the formation of toxic species in neuroblastoma cells,
and completely suppresses Aβ42 deposition and its consequences in a
Caenorhabditis elegans model of Aβ42-mediated toxicity. These results suggest
that the prevention of the primary nucleation of Aβ42 by compounds such as
bexarotene could reduce the risk of the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26933687/
4.   HUMAN_BRICHOS_DOMAIN
A molecular chaperone, a human Brichos domain, can specifically inhibit this
catalytic cycle and limit human Aβ42 toxicity. It has been demonstrated in
vitro that Brichos binds to the surfaces of fibrils, thereby redirecting the
aggregation reaction to a pathway that involves the minimal formation of beta-
amyloid oligomers.

 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25686087/

5.   IMMUNOTHERAPY
 
Immunotherapy involves the injection of an antibody that targets abnormal Aβ
and facilitates its removal from the brain. Immunotherapy against Aβ has proven
to be ineffective unless it is used during the early stages of AD.
 The selective immunological blockade of specific biding sites for Aβ might be
an effective approach at an early stage of AD. In one such study conducted in
OBX-mice, immunization with the fragments of extracellular domains of α7-
subtype of the acetylcholine or prion receptors, evident improvement has been
observed in both spatial memory and morphology of cortical and hippocampal
neurons as well as Aβ level lowering. The antibodies to these fragments had to
be noticed to exert obvious protective effects on hippocampal cells culture as
well.
 
 The potential clinical benefit of immunomodulatory treatment in the earliest
stages of AD is dependent on the rate of cognitive decline as well as the
severity of the neuroinflammatory response. The activation states of microglia
and the neuroinflammatory environment are constantly changing throughout the
course of AD progression. Therefore, when choosing the target of modulation,
the timing of intervention is highly important.

 
6.   ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
 
This targets the neuroinflammatory pathology in AD. Modulation of cytokine
systems has been shown to correct dysregulated neuroinflammation in mouse
models of AD and restore efficient Aβ clearance. However, the nature of these
cytokines (pro- or anti-inflammatory) along with the specific timing of
intervention is also critically important in the outcome.
 
Epidemiological studies suggest that sustained combinatorial NSAID usage can
reduce the risk of AD onset by as much as 80% and numerous NSAID compounds have
been efficient in reducing microglial activation and amyloid burden in animal
models of AD. However, NSAID treatment could be protective if initiated before
clinical symptom onset but harmful after the development of cognitive
impairment.
 
Numerous cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs derived from plant
polyphenols, including curcumin, apigenin, and resveratrol, carry strong
preclinical evidence as potential AD therapies. These compounds inhibit nuclear
factor kappa B activity and decrease the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. Recently etanercept, a TNFα inhibitor, was shown to be well
tolerated a provide some therapeutic benefit in an initial phase-II AD clinical
trial
 
 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jnc.13411
7.   EXOSOMES
Exosomes, a form of nanoscale vesicle, are commonly found in the biological
fluids and tissues of the central nervous system. They carry a small amount of
molecular genetic material and proteins that play key roles in intercellular
communication.
In cellular and animal models of AD, exosomes have been shown to carry and
spread toxic Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau, between neural cells and may then
induce cell apoptosis, thus resulting in the loss of neurons. On the other
hand, exosomes may also exert positive actions, including the reduction of
brain amyloid-beta, or the transfer of neuroprotective substances between
neural cells. For example, the up-regulation of exosomes containing nSMase2
secretion enhances Aβ uptake in microglia and significantly reduces the
extracellular levels of Aβ.
 
Since neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) exist in both cerebrospinal fluid and
peripheral blood, targeting changes in the exosomes during the pathogenesis of
AD might provide a new alternative approach with which to treat AD.
 
A research study showed that the intravenous delivery of Mesenchymal Stem Cells
allowed transport across the blood-brain barrier and subsequent migration to
sites of neural injury without inducing tumorigenic or immune responses. MSCs
can exert their action through exosomes.
MSCs have also been shown to promote cognitive function in various pathological
conditions, including neuro-regeneration, neuroprotection, the reduction of Aβ
deposits and tau-related cell death, and the down-regulation of pro-
inflammatory cytokines. 
                   From_<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov  
8. TARGETING_TAU_PHOSPHORYLATION
Another step that can be targeted in AD pathology is tau hyperphosphorylation
and NFT formation. Several potential therapeutic approaches have been
identified: modulation of tau phosphorylation, prevention of tau aggregation,
promotion of tau clearance by intracellular and extracellular proteolysis and
phagocytosis, and anti-tau-directed immunotherapies. Only a few drugs that
target tau phosphorylation and aggregation have reached late-stage clinical
trials. This may be due to differences in structure, conformation, and
complexity of changes during AD of tau protein compared to Aβ (while Aβ
consists of 36–42 amino acids, the human central nervous system expresses six
tau isoforms that comprise from 352 to 441 amino acids with four sequence
repeats in normal). Moreover, changes in Aβ and tau during the progression of
AD are very different. Extracellular Aβ modifications during AD progression
involve slow polymerization into oligomers that further aggregate. Initial tau
modifications in AD progression are intracellular. Therefore, targeting tau
protein as the therapeutic approach proves to be more complex than targeting
Aβ. 
                         https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839593/
9.   UNCONVENTIONAL_METHODS_-_AROMATHERAPY
    
     Unconventional methods like aromatherapy and light therapy have also shown
promising results in improving sleep, abstract function, and conceptual
understanding in AD patients. It has been suggested that aromatherapy may bring
some feeling of relief and the ability to act on outside influences that can
help cope with the obstacle to action in senile dementia.

 The action of aromatherapy begins from a smell molecule combined with an
acceptor peculiar to each specific odor. The smell molecule passes along the
nasal cavity and adheres to the olfactory epithelium. The stimulus is
transmitted to the hippocampus or cerebral limbic system and amygdaloid body
through the olfactory nerve system currently concentrated on the olfactory
epithelium. The odor is recognized and the stimulus sends information to the
hypothalamus on which it was projected by the cerebral limbic system, which
then adjusts the autonomic nervous system and the internal secretory system,
guiding a series of vital reactions in the hippocampus or amygdaloid body, such
as the discharge of neurotransmitters.
 
This_study explored the effects of aromatherapy on cognitive functions of AD
and dementia patients. The oils used in aromatherapy were lemon, rosemary,
lavender, and orange. The lemon and rosemary mix was believed to activate the
sympathetic nervous system to strengthen concentration and memory, whereas the
lavender and orange fragrance activated the parasympathetic nervous system to
calm patients' anxiety. The mixtures used in the mornings and evenings were
changed to synchronize the autonomic nervous system to the circadian rhythm:
the sympathetic nervous system works predominantly after stimulation by
rosemary–lemon oil in the morning, whereas the parasympathetic nerve system
works predominantly after activation by the lavender–orange oil at night.
 
The study concluded that a significant improvement was seen in GBSS-J-A-13
(abstract function) in the mild-moderate AD group. Some improvement was seen in
the overall score for the TDAS and in concept understanding in all patient
groups.

 DISCUSSION
 The pathogenesis of AD has 3 components - Accumulation of Aß amyloids,
Formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and Neuroinflammation.
1._Aß_amyloids_and_tau_proteins
 Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is an integral membrane protein expressed
mainly in synapses of neurons. It regulates synapse formation, synaptic
plasticity, antimicrobial activity, and iron export. APP is cleaved by ß
secretase to produce APP C99, which undergoes further cleavages by gamma-
secretase to produce amyloid ß peptides. Disruption of this cleavage process,
specifical mutations in gamma and beta-secretases, can lead to the abnormal
production of Aβ. Aβ can then trigger a cascade leading to synaptic damage and
neuron loss. 
[Drug_treatments_in_Alzheimer’s_disease_(nih.gov)]
 



Tau proteins are microtubule-associated proteins, predominantly expressed in
neurons of the CNS. One of the main functions of tau proteins is to modulate
the stability of axonal microtubules by interacting with tubulin and promoting
its assembly into microtubules. It does this by 2 mechanisms: isoforms and
phosphorylation. Tau protein also regulates microtubule-mediated axonal
transport. Non-cellular functions of tau include negatively regulating long-
term memory and facilitating habituation. This can explain the linkage between
tauopathies and cognitive impairment.  Abnormal amyloid plaque can induce the
phosphorylation of tau protein, which then spreads almost infectiously via
microtubule transport to neighboring neurons, leading to neuronal death.
[https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1161/v1]
 In early AD, the first detectable signs that can be observed in a structural
MRI are atrophy in the middle temporal lobe (affecting especially the
hippocampus), and a decrease in the thickness of the cerebral cortex in regions
that are vulnerable to AD. In asymptomatic carriers of APP mutations, a
decrease in hippocampal volume can be identified 2–3 years before the onset of
dementia and, in elderly people, this alteration can be detected up to six
years before [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6888399/]
Memory impairments appear to be significantly correlated with medial temporal
lobe atrophy and hypoactivation. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC5684784/]
As the disease progresses, delusions, hallucinations, and aggression become
more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout
all the stages of AD. Additionally, circadian sleep-wake rhythms become
exaggerated as compared with the phase shifts associated with normal aging.
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3299979/]
Swallowing disorders of the AD group may result from sensory impairment in
relation to dysfunctions in the temporoparietal areas, whereas the swallowing
disorders of VaD group may primarily be caused by motor impairments due to
disruptions in the corticobulbar tract. AD with EPS predominantly shows
rigidity and bradykinesia. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC3299979/]

2._Neurofibrillary_Tangles
Neurofibrillary tangles are formed by hyperphosphorylation of the
aforementioned microtubule-associated protein tau, causing it to aggregate in
an insoluble form. These aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are
referred to as PHF or "paired helical filaments".
Intracellular lesions known as pretangles develop when tau is phosphorylated
excessively and on improper amino acid residues. These lesions, over time,
develop into filamentous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which interfere with
numerous intracellular functions. In asymptomatic patients, the presence of
neurofibrillary tangles tends to be limited to the entorhinal cortex, while in
symptomatic subjects, tangles are much more widespread. 
A recent study looked for a correlation between the quantitative aspects of
Alzheimer's disease and aggression frequently found in Alzheimer's patients. It
was found that only an increase in neurofibrillary tangle load was associated
with the severity of aggression and chronic aggression in Alzheimer's patients.
This indicates a correlation between NFT load and the severity of aggression.

3._Inflammation

a._General_Mechanism


 
 
b._Macrophage_Activation_Theory


 
 
c._Astrocytes
Astrocytes may be more efficient in Aβ1–42 uptake than microglia and show a
preference for uptake of neurotoxic oligomeric Aβ rather than the fibrillary
formation.
Even though astrocytes are primarily supportive of neuronal function, they can
also secrete early-phase pro-inflammatory cytokines in conditions of brain
injury that can exacerbate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Thus,
therapies targeting neuroinflammation must keep in mind the contribution of
astrocytes in the progression of the disease.
