               Conversational learning outcomes:


               Rakesh Biswas presents the patient data that was
               logged and  compiled into a case report by Dr
               Navya, Intern :

               "A young man with chronic diarrhoea and severe
               hypoalbuminemia and generalized body swelling
               patient that we are currently grappling with and
               will appreciate your inputs 

               "More details here: https://

               old-man-from-north-east-india.html?m=1

Inputs 1 from Amit Taneja 

Not my area of expertise, however this is not IBD. If you have access to EGD
and push enteroscopy it will be very useful to get biopsies. Clinical diagnosis
is malabsorption syndrome and/or protein losing enteropathy. Cause needs to be
elucidated. Work up for sprue-tropical and celiac; pancreatic insufficiency and
finally obtaining biopsy. Should also screen for HIV as that will widen the ddx

RB reply 

Colonoscopy pending. Rest done and dead ends.

Inputs 2 from Amit Taneja 

Rakesh Biswas what did egd and small bowel follow through or push enteroscopy
show? And on biopsies

RB reply 2

Upper GI endoscopy done earlier appeared normal but small bowel enema and push
enteroscopy may remain pending due to affordability constraints

RB reply 3

Amit Taneja quoting from 
 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542283/#_NBK542283_pubdet_

"The three main groups of disorders that cause excess protein loss in stools
are:

1) Primary Erosive/Ulcerative gastrointestinal Disorders

This group of conditions includes inflammatory bowel diseases (both ulcerative
colitis and Crohn disease), Gastrointestinal malignancies, any erosions or
ulcers of stomach or duodenum, Clostridium difficile colitis, carcinoid
syndrome, graft vs. host disease."



Inputs from Aadipta Ghosh 

Do fecal fat studies including Sudan qualitative stain for fat, 72-hour
quantitative fecal fat collection, and fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin. Also go for
small bowel barium series for mucosal abnormalities typical of malabsorption
syndromes

RB reply 

Well take a look at the jar of "paneer curry" sign in the image uploaded in his
case log

AG reply 

Yes then we need to rule out non erosive causes of protein losing enteropathy
and primary intestinal telengiectasia. Also rule out mesenteric tuberculosis or
sarcoidosis,  lymphoma

 RB reply 

Yes Aadipta Ghosh for biopsy one does also need to spot some macroscopic
findings in the endoscopy to guide the location of the biopsy. What if the
findings are in the jejunum alone? How do we visualize that area? 

Two days after 

RB update : Upper and lower GI endoscopy apparently normal. Now what empirical
Diet therapy? 😐


Amit Taneja reply: Rakesh Biswas did they do random biopsies? And if so, were
they normal?
If you have a medical student or an intern, good mental exercise for them to
approach it from the angle of making a table of causes of malabsorption
syndromes and protein losing enteropathies. Then crossing off the ones with
normal mucosa and biopsies?? And see what we are left with??

RB reply: 

Yes they did and we will need to wait for the biopsy reports but it's a great
idea to see what would still show normal findings microscopically

Four days later biopsy report discussion:

RB: Check out this patient's intestinal biopsy images uploaded on the patient's
case log above

SK Biswas, Prof Pathology,  Jinan University, Guangzhou : few blunted villi -
can it be tropical sprue with superadded giardiasis?

RB reply : Yes likely. 

And the organisms could be something that resembles giardia but may be named as
"spruella tropicana?"

Inputs from KIMs Microbology Hod: Sir, we did not find Trophozoites in repeat
sample.  We found only few cysts.Above picture is showing Trophozoites. Sir,
pathology report is  from our Institute ?

Rakesh Biswas: Yes KHL

KIMs Micro Hod: Ok sir. After that patient took medication?

Rakesh Biswas: No we didn't give him any medication for his giardiasis till
now. 

He improved on a gluten free diet so I'm not yet sure if these organisms were
responsible for his problem

KIMs Micro HoD: But, histopathology picture showing Trophozoites & in our
microscopy ,few cysts were seen. Definitely infection is present

Kims Aditya Samitinjay: Ma'am is it feasible to treat with a 3 week course of
Metronidazole for this patient ?

KIMs Microbology HOD: I have to verify treatment guidelines

Dr Faraz : Good evening sir and ma'am. Could the intraepithelial lymphocytosis
and villous atrophy present be associated with celiac disease? His improvement
on a gluten free diet is also another factor pointing towards that.

Kims Aditya Samitinjay: Sir he may have improved with Racecadotril and
Loperamide ?

Rakesh Biswas: 👍yes thanks for these very useful inputs. 

I too think as Dr Faraaz mentions that his histopathological changes can still
be explained with gluten and as three interventions had been delivered to him
at the same time unless and when we can remove the racecadotril and loperamide
from his regime. Let's see we will hopefully do that soon

Dr Faraz : I m not convinced with the morphology as the shape & nucleus don't
look like giardiasis 
May b some protozoan commensals

Kims Aditya Samitinjay: Good evening ma'am. This patient's stool microscopy
report on 30th August 2019 did not show any parasites or cysts, However it
showed 12- 14 WBCs/hpf. This could mean his symptoms are unrelated to this
Giardiasis ? And may in fact be due to Celiac Disease ?

Kims Aditya Samitinjay: Ma'am are there any features of giardiasis which could
suggest chronicity ?

Rakesh Biswas: Aditya just review the literature around histopathology of
chronic giardiasis

Kims Aditya Samitinjay: Partial villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and
monocytosis of lamina propria sir.

Rakesh Biswas: Alright so essentially all these chronic changes are not
specific to any particular organism and just indicate chronic mucosal damage
due non specific inflammatory response


Update four days later:

RB: Have started him on Tinidazole today but here is a preemptive read to think
through and ahead into the problem https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/
article/pii/S1198743X17302896


Update 10 days later 

Relapsed again today after completing five days of Tinidazole by Feb 16.
