**** What is a Morbidity meeting? ****
MORTALITY / MORBIDITY MEETING NOTICE 

The morbidity meeting scheduled for 4th xxxuary, 2xxx (xxxday, 2.00 pm to
4.00pm)

Venue:  Auditorium

The first case presenting with a morbidity of 3 months and admitted with us for
7 days shared below is for illustrative purposes only and will not be
presented. It has been shared to debate the current definition of morbidity
meeting, which can in essence originate from any ‘patient with morbidity/
illness,’ meeting his/her first caregiver and discussing his/her problems to
move towards a sustainable solution (let’s call it m1). This would be followed
by many more such meetings m1,m2,..Mn between various stakeholders in the
patient’s care and one such may get presented in a mini auditorium such as ours
but it doesn’t signify the end of morbidity meetings for the patient which is
likely to continue till s/he finds a sustainable cure. Clinical audit of such
care delivery pathways in patients (individual or collective) involves
collecting patient data and analyzing it qualitatively by asking questions as a
first step, finding out the answers from past experiential as well as empirical
literature and finally sharing it in ‘morbidity meetings’ such as ours so that
a collective opinion is shared to effect the patient’s subsequent care.

   1. A 50 year old man with progressive abdominal pain with vomiting since
      last 3 months and tenderness in the paraumbilical  region with no history
      suggestive of sepsis. On CT abdomen, patient was found to have a large
      cystic lesion in right hypochondrium possibly arising as a sequelae of
      pancreatic inflammation. Patient was admitted and put on injection taxim
      and injection tramadol for last 7 days.

The following clinic audit queries need to be answered after the concerned PGs
get in touch with the radiologist as well as review the literature.

Where is the cyst anatomically located in relation to the pancreas? Is it in
the greater sac or lesser sac or both? If in greater sac is it communicating
with the pancreatic duct? Why is it not causing pancreatic ascites? What would
be the disadvantages of an external drainage in such a situation? If planning
internal drainage given the CT findings what would be the disadvantages of a
cystogastrostomy vs cystojejunostomy?

What is the role of antibiotics in Pseudocyst without any evidence of sepsis?

What is the role of aspiration in management of an infected Pseudocyst?

What is the role of prophylactic antibiotics in intestinal obstruction    

   1. A 3 months old female child presented with complaints of cough and cold
      since 2 days, vomitings and rapid breathing since 2 days. Has issues of
      diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties since xxth xxxuary 2xxx.  

3.A 55 years old man known case of congestive cardiac failure with reduced
ejection fraction (21%) . 


Note: The presenting residents are requested to share further patient details
with the current coordinating M & M team to facilitate the discussion for their
presentations adequately.
