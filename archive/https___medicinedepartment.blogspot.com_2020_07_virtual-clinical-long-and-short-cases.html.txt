**** Virtual Clinical Long and Short cases Online Question bank ****
For more about why this sudden epidemic of virtual assessments that have
enormous endemic potential please see the link here https://
medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/07/virtual-case-based-assessment-post-
covid.html?m=1

We share below links to our virtual cases who are not simulations but
deidentified real patients with whom our doctors are in regular touch through
online Telemedicine virtually. We do this following a case report publication
model after obtaining signed informed consent from every patient and ensuring
anonymity.

           1) Where are the different anatomical locations for the
          cause of the problem  for each of these patients?

          2) What is the most likely pathology and etiology in that
          anatomical location?

          3) What are the diagnostic and therapeutic options in such
          situations and what is the efficacy of each option/
          intervention?

          4) Please share questions that come to your mind upon going
          through each of the cases.
