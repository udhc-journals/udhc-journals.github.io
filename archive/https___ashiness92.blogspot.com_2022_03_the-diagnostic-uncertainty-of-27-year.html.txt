She first reported to our outpatient unit with  oral ulcerations, tongue

of weight of around 10 kgs over the last 6 month along with low grade
intermittent fever over the past few months.

 FNAC of her cervical lymph node was done which revealed Reactive
lymphadenitis. It was even sent to CBNAAT in suspicion of TB and which was also
negative.

IGRA - negative 

After sending her ANA profile it turned out with be negative as well.

We decided to do a lymph node biopsy after convincing the patient and her
husband.
