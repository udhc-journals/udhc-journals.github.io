**** 35 yr female with shortness of breath ****
February_27,_2022
A 35 year old female from marapaka, came to casualty with c/o shortness of
breath since 20 days. 
History of present illness :-
Pt was apparently asymptomatic, 2 months back then she developed breathlessness
which is insiduous in onset since 20 days which aggrevated on performing
physical work and was relieved on rest. Then she  visited a local hospital in
miryalaguda, on evaluation she had low hemoglobin count and 2 blood
transfusions were done and was given medicines for a week. After using these
medicines for one week she developed bilateral pedal edema (pitting type). So
she visited a hospital in guntur. As there are no aarogyasri services in guntur
she came back to nalgonda regarding the same issue. She had one more blood
transfusion in Nalgonda hospital. Later she developed breathlessness and
visited our hospital. She was on medication and her breathlessness subsided
after 3 days of admission. She had 5 blood transfusions here and was on
dialysis(10). Pedal edema did not subside after dialysis and also had a
complaint of abdominal tightness.
History of past illness :-
History of abortion two years back followed by four months of amenorrhea and
then bleeding for 3 months continuously. Changed five pads per day which were
fully soaked and was not associated with pain . Spontaneously subsided 3 months
later. No burning micturition and white discharge. No pain in the abdomen.
