 _October_30,_2020_
This is an online E log book to discuss our patient's de-identified health data
shared after taking his/her/guardian's signed informed consent. 
Here we discuss our individual patient's problems through series of inputs from
available global online community of experts with an aim to solve those
patient's clinical problems with collective current best evidence based
inputs. 
This E log book also reflects my patient-centered online learning portfolio and
your valuable inputs on the comment box is welcome. 
Here's a case that I have seen - 
A 35 year old labourer, a father of two, presented to the OPD with the
complaints of pedal oedema (upto the ankle) facial puffiness and abdominal
discomfort since 3 days. 
He was apparently assymptomatic 3 months back. Then he developed pedal oedema
for the first time for which he visited the RMP who prescribed Torsemide. The
oedema subsided after taking the medication. The patient got the confidence
that it will decrease everytime after taking the medication so he continued
consuming alcohol and taking that medicine everytime he got developed oedema
(3-4 times according to the patient and more than that according to the
attender) 
The pedal oedema was bilateral, gradual in onset, non-progressive, pitting
type, non-tender.
The pedal oedema was followed by facial puffiness.
He has H/O chest trauma on the right side of the chest 1 month back (He fell
from the bike after consuming alcohol) after which he developed chest pain on
the right side of the chest and palpitations on and off. 
He last consumed alcohol 5 days ago after which he developed pedal oedema and
facial puffiness again. He even developed abdominal discomfort and shortness of
breath at rest. He visited the RMP again who advised him to go to Kamineni,
Narketpally. 
Past History - 
Patient had a perianal abscess 5 years ago. 
He had painful defecation associated with pain in the perianal region, foul
smelling stools and pus discharge in stools. No H/O blood stained stools. The
patient visited the RMP for this as well and it subsided with the medication
given by the RMP. Patient developed similar complaints 3 days ago. 
Not a known case of Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Epilepsy, Asthma,
Tuberculosis, CVA, CAD 

Personal History - 
Mixed diet 
Normal appetite 
Adequate sleep 
Regualr Bowel and Bladder Movements

Regular intake of alcohol since the past 10 years and chewing on tobacco since
the past 3 years. 
The patient dropped out of school after finishing 9th standard due to financial
troubles and started working at a tiles factory. The patient got married early
at the age of 21 years. He started consuming alcohol 10 years ago at the age of
25 years due to peer pressure from his friends. He started by drinking 5ml of
sara which gradually increased to 90ml of whiskey and then quarter bottle of
whiskey everyday. The patient started chewing tobacco 3 years ago as he feels
relieved on chewing tobacco after a tough day at work. He consumes 1-2 packets
everyday. 
The patient tried to stop consuming alcohol 1 month ago due to pedal oedema and
maintained abstinence for 15-20 days by using some herbal medication but was
unsuccessful. 
The patient last consumed alcohol 5 days ago on Monday before he got
hospitalized. He consumed 3 quarters of whiskey on Monday (As he was visiting
his different groups of friends)
