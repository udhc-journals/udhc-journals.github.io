**** A daily pragmatic learning roster as per MCI summative and formative
assessment guidelines ****
The current MCI summative and formative assessment guidelines can be accessed
online here https://www.mciindia.org/CMS/information-desk/for-colleges/pg-
curricula-2

Quoting briefly from those below:

Final university MD medicine summative assessment also known as the Post
graduate examination shall be in three parts:

1. Thesis

2) Theory that would include four theory papers, as below:

Paper I: Basic Medical Sciences (at the end of first year of training)

Paper II: Medicine and allied specialties including pediatrics, dermatology &
 psychiatry

Paper III: Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases

Paper IV: Recent Advances in Medicine

3. Clinical / Practical and Oral/viva voce Examination:

The final clinical examination should include:

 cases pertaining to major systems

 stations for clinical, procedural and communication skills

 Log Book Records and day-to-day observation during the training (Record of
formative assessment-logical interpretation)

 Oral/viva voce examination shall be comprehensive enough to test the
 post graduate student’s overall knowledge of the subject

Daily Roster:

1) For evaluation around "cases pertaining to major systems"

The student regularly begins the day evaluating the cases admitted in his her
unit and presents it to the professor (also a university examiner) in the grand
rounds. In the absence of the professor the next in command is to be presented
the cases for analysis and decision making.

2) For evaluation of "clinical, procedural and communication skills," the
students will be assessed in their grand round case for these specific
competencies using technique of cross examination of their performance along
with recorded videos of them performing the procedures.

3) Oral viva voce shall include questions related to the necessary knowledge
needed in resolution of diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty in their regular
cared for  individual cases, by formulating evidence based queries in the PICO
format, reviewing the literature by searching online and finally critically
appraising the accessed literature in the form of regular journal clubs and
seminars. All these regular activity shall be documented and shared by the
student in his her E logbook aka "online learning portfolio."

4) For regular practice and evaluation of thesis and theory retention skills,
the student shall have a regular 2-4 PM session to discuss his her thesis face
to face with all the departmental members for their feedback on his her current
prowess and a regular online thesis case-data sharing session through his her E
log book. The student's theory retention skills will be tested by asking them
to prepare a speech on one theory topic for the day so as to not only enable
his prowess to tackle the summative theory papers on D day but  also test his
pedagogic skills in imparting knowledge.
