**** Learning competency objectives and outcomes in "Third World" theory
lectures ****
Theory lecture classes are still taken in the "third world." 

The third world exists across the Atlantic and Pacific of the united First
World. By theory lectures, the third world understands something like a copy
pasted power point full of factual content that should act as a morning
sedative to counteract the strongest cup of coffee a student may have
inadvertently tried to poison herself with. 

Here are a few quick bullet points taken from a theory lecture that was
prepared for the First World (rewarded with $$) and the video of that lecture
is also linked at the end although this post is mostly about "how to" design a
competency based medical education "lecture class." Unfortunately this is a
"patient centered lecture class" something that is still anathema in the third
world but it is and has been practiced in isolated pockets for quite a few
decades. 


Learning Objectives:

By the end of this session the participants will be able to learn the following
points around this patient:-

1.Significance of History taking in diagnosis

2.Thorough Clinical Examination

3.Auxillary examination findings in narrowing down the differential diagnosis

4.Summary of events in patient’s life

5.Graphical Timeline

6.Global Health Challenges to rule out diagnostic uncertainities

7.Solutions to these challenges


Learning objectives and expected competency outcomes:


1. Significance of meticulously capturing patient event data aka clinical
history and achieve competency in the documenting and analyzing the same around
the clinical problem mentioned in the title. 

2. Significance of meticulously capturing patient body data through body
surface examination (clinical signs) and achieve competency around documenting
and analyzing the same. 

3. Importance of capturing patient body data through imaging and laboratory
diagnostics and achieve competency in documenting and analyzing the same. 

4. Importance of summarizing, analysing and sharing the patient timeline of
events along with captured data. 

5. Understand the global health challenges in resolving diagnostic and
therapeutic uncertainties 

6. Brainstorm impactful global solutions to the above patient centred
challenges. 

7. Summarize competencies attained at the end of the session by generating for
themselves similar formative patient centered learning portfolios toward
impactful sharing.

Learning points-

1. A thorough ,chronological history, serves the main basis of identifying the
differentials


2. Meticulous glance of the Patient carves ways to important signs of diseases.

3. Mastering Clinical skills in narrowing differentials , further limits
Overtesting ,hence Over or Under treatment of patients.

4. Physicians always must pay attention to a persisting ,modern Pandemic-
Antibiotic resistance.

5. Developing Low cost tools for diagnosis and management of patient


6. Efficient follow up and precise Management can be a strong step in
harnessing the certainties to the uncertainties of dignosis and therapy.

8. A Top Down approach , can serve a significant technique to resolve certain
uncertainties where we arrive as a retrospective diagnosis when there’s
response to a certain therapy.

Learning Summary 

1. We shared a patient with a clinical problem such as cough and hemoptysis and
tried learning from the different steps toward solving the patient's problem. 

2. We discovered particular events in the patient's life, recent and past that
pointed towards the root cause of her illness 

3. We learned how clinical skills to capture  data from the patient's body can
afford valuable clues to the root cause of the problem. 

4. We learned how laboratory diagnostic imaging and sampling of body fluids and
tissues can allow us to penetrate deeper into the clinical problem. 

5. We understood that there are many challenges and uncertainties to diagnosis
and therapy in low or mixed resource settings 

6. We understood that these uncertainties can resolve over time and
informational continuity with the patient is of paramount importance 

7. We understood that a student can document and share his "patient centered
learning" experiences through his online learning portfolio and create global
cognitive impact while locally benefiting positively the lives of their
patients.
