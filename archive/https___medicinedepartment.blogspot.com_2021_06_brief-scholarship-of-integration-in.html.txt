Brief :

Scholarship of integration in Medical education and research : what it is and
what it isnt:
Scholarship of integration in medical education and research makes connections
within and between disciplines, locating knowledge in a broader context giving
meaning to specific discoveries. 

It aims to distribute the fruits of academic discovery to benefit specific
individual members of society aka patients who in turn help academics to
multiply the construction of new knowledge translated into practice. 

Scholarship of integration in Medical education and research is not just about
integrating scholarship of teaching learning with the scholarship of discovery
but is all about integration of patient centered societal goals with teaching
and learning. 


It is vital that academic institutions and medical schools remain relevant in
an era when the production of knowledge is increasingly recognized as a social
collaborative activity. 

Scholarship of integration, enables shared knowledge through a participatory
framework and includes practical methods to guide institutional change along
with reporting and evaluating them.  

Scholarship of integration focuses on outcomes not just on student learning but
also in the context of Medical education directed toward it's  ultimate
beneficiaries, that is the patients themselves, through a framework that
enables driving of patient outcomes through student learning outcomes and a
real time clinical audit trail that allows us to join the dots between the
two.
