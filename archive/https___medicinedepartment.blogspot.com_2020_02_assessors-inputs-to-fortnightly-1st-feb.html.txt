**** Assessor's inputs to Fortnightly 1st Feb 2020 INTERNAL ASSESSMENT EXAM FOR
1st and 2nd YEAR PG STUDENTS ****


This is the version of the question paper with answers from the examinees aka
respondents or responders (and other random online visitors) along with
multiple assessor inputs to those answers.

The second assessor has provided some inputs on the assessment process and the
first assessor too before s/he actually started assessing the examinee inputs
and to quote below:

"[2/6, 11:21 PM] Well I think most of the first respondent's answers were
pretty much copy paste with no reference. Also very bookish but I also felt the
questions were too long sir.
[2/6, 11:22 PM]  In fact the lack of awareness of what referencing a source or
even appraising literature means they couldn't grasp the idea in the first
place.
[2/6, 11:23 PM] However the answers were informative and to the point.
[2/6, 11:25 PM] The first assessor's comments are still only corrective. Like
telling the responder to cite a reference or not to copy more than 1 line from
a source or to appraise the literature accordingly. These are basic stuff which
the responder should know in the first place and the assessor's comments should
ideally be focused on a discussion around the answer rather than these
corrections."


DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL MEDICINE
INTERNAL ASSESSMENT EXAM FOR 1st and 2nd YEAR PG STUDENTS

Answer all questions                                                           
                        Max Marks: 60
Time: 2pm to 4pm                                                               
                       Date: 01.02.2020


There are in total ‘3’ questions. The 3 long questions are 20 marks each
with two parts of 10 marks, one specifically related to the case and the other
more general as per tradition. The paper is designed to be answered by you in a
blended offline and online format. Most of the real patient data presented here
is due to our hardworking interns who have obtained signed informed consent
from patients and then captured deidentified history and images. It has been
shared nearly unchanged with minimal editing. 

Q1. A 50 year old man with progressive abdominal pain with vomiting since last
3 months and tenderness in the paraumbilical  region with no history suggestive
of sepsis. On CT abdomen, patient was found to have a large cystic lesion in
right hypochondrium possibly arising as a sequelae of pancreatic inflammation.
Patient was admitted and put on injection taxim and injection tramadol for last
7 days.

a) Please check out the CT images of the abdomen (also check radspa and discuss
with the Radiology PGs for the entire set of images)

 and write the answers to the following: 

Where is the cyst anatomically located in relation to the pancreas? Is it in
the greater sac or lesser sac or both? If in greater sac is it communicating
with the pancreatic duct? Why is it not causing pancreatic ascites? What would
be the disadvantages of an external drainage in such a situation? If planning
internal drainage given the CT findings what would be the disadvantages of a
cystogastrostomy vs cystojejunostomy? (3 marks)

     A) Pseudocyst is related anteriorly to head of pancreas
     Not in continuity with either greater or lesser sac 
     In continuity with main pancreatic duct
     In this case as pseudocyst is in close proximity with jejunum hence
     cystojejunostomy

 First assessor: 

This is an original answer from you unlike the others below which are not (but
that is again partly due to the nature of the questions) and this exercise is
about how to share publicly in a useful and safe manner that also teaches us to
beware of plagiarism.

Coming to the first original answer did you find time to discuss this with the
radiologist? Let me know if they agree or have anything more to add.  

Also did you answer all these questions below? 

"Why is it not causing pancreatic ascites? What would be the disadvantages of
an external drainage in such a situation? If planning internal drainage given
the CT findings what would be the disadvantages of a cystogastrostomy vs
cystojejunostomy?"

     B)

b) Is there a role of antibiotics in Pseudocyst without any evidence of sepsis?
Please substantiate with evidence from review of literature (3 marks) 

     Did not find any evidence suggesting use of antibiotics in pseudocyst
     without any evidence of sepsis.

Please share your search key words. Did you use "antibiotic prophylaxis
pseudocyst"?

What is the role of aspiration in management of an infected Pseudocyst? 
Please substantiate with evidence from review of literature (2 marks) 

Assessor's inputs: You didn't answer the question above? Also you confused by
marking the answer below as (c) when it appears to actually attempt to answer
question (d) 

Ok I just noticed you sent the answer to (c) in a different email/post


C) After diagnostic needle aspiration guided by computed tomography and/or
ultrasound, 11 infected pseudocysts in ten patients were treated nonoperatively
by percutaneous catheter drainage and intravenously administered antibiotics.
Nine infected pseudocysts resolved after 11 to 37 days (mean, 21 days) with no
recurrences at follow-up 16 to 42 months (mean, 24.4 months) later. All were
confirmed by Gram's stain, culture, and elevated amylase levels. Ten of the
pseudocysts were acute; one was chronic; five were polymicrobial; six had a
single organism. There were no major complications. There was one failure when
a pancreatic abscess developed in a patient who died following operative
drainage. There was one successful palliation of a postoperative-infected
pseudocyst in a patient with an obstructing nonresectable carcinoma of the head
of the pancreas. A trial of percutaneous catheter drainage is indicated in
patients with infected pancreatic pseudocysts.
Percutaneous_Drainage_of_Infected_Pancreatic_Pseudocysts
Assessor's inputs: unfortunately the above doesn't really explain what you
plainly copy pasted and assumes your audience will just get it from the data of
an abstract that appears to be a case series! 😅


d) What is the role of prophylactic antibiotics in intestinal obstruction? 

Please substantiate with evidence from review of literature (2 marks) 



Assessor's input (wrongly indicated as 'c' while answering?) 

      C) Fifty-seven assessable patients were randomly assigned in a
     double-blind fashion to therapy with 1 g of cefonicid intravenously
     (iv) or intramuscularly (im) 1 hr before surgery only or 2 g of
     cefoxitin iv or im 1 hr before surgery and 2 g every 6 hr for 24 hr.

Assessor butting in:

This answer starts rather abruptly and catches the audience unawares.

Perhaps you are discussing the evidence  in terms of a single RCT to begin
with? Your answer needs to clarify that with an introduction. 

     Groups were comparable in terms of underlying diseases. Samples for
     blood culture were obtained immediately before and after surgery and
     at 8:00 A.M. on the first and second postoperative days. No blood
     cultures were positive. Two of 30 patients receiving cefonicid
     developed wound infections (6%). Two of 27 patients receiving
     cefoxitin developed wound infections, and one developed an
     intraabdominal abscess (11%). No significant adverse effects were
     noted. The results suggest cefonicid may be an effective prophylactic
     antibiotic for bowel surgery. 

Not sure how it answers the actual question about role of prophylactic
antibiotics in intestinal obstruction. The treating unit PGs, on informal
clinical audit had mentioned that they were administering antibiotics to the
patient also as they suspected intestinal obstruction and hence the origin of
the question. A study that may have answered it would have been antibiotics vs
placebo? Are you able to find one?

Assessor's inputs: There appears to be a lot of copy paste (aka generous
borrowing of quotes till they can't be called quotes any longer) without any
attribution. Strangely in traditional handwritten paper based offline exams
where just one assessor is tortured with these answers, this may even be lauded
with good marks because the question was essentially asking for it. 😅

     Pancreatic pseudocyst

     Pseudocysts form when the cells of the pancreas become inflamed or
     are injured and pancreatic enzymes start to leak. Leaking of the
     enzymes harms the tissue of the pancreas. Pancreatic pseudocysts are
     different from true pancreatic cysts. Both cysts and pseudocysts are
     collections of fluid. A true cyst is a closed structure. It has a
     lining of cells that separates it from the nearby tissue. A
     pseudocyst isn’t closed and doesn’t have a lining of epithelial cells
     separating it from the nearby tissue.
     Etiology-
     Pancreatic pseudocysts may start after an episode of sudden (acute)
     pancreatitis. People with chronic pancreatitis can also get
     pseudocysts. They may also form in conditions that cause long-term
     pancreas inflammation (chronic pancreatitis).
     Gallstones
     Chronic alcoholism
         * Pancreas injury or trauma
         * Pancreas infection
         * Pancreatic tumor
         * High levels of calcium in your blood
         * Very high levels of blood fats (cholesterol)
         * Pancreatic damage from medicines
         * Autoimmune diseases
     Clinical features
         * Stomach pain. 
         * Fever
         * Swollen belly
         * Nausea and vomiting
         * An abdominal mass detected on physical exam
         * Severe pancreatitis may also cause dehydration and low blood
           pressure.
     Treatment

     Treatment for the pseudocyst may vary. Many pseudocysts will go away
     with supportive care.

Short note 3:

     ERCP 

     Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a combined
     endoscopic and fluoroscopic procedure in which an upper endoscope is
     led into a second part of the duodenum, making it possible for
     passage of other tools via the major duodenal papilla into the
     biliary and pancreatic ducts. Contrast material may be injected in
     these ducts, allowing for radiologic visualization and therapeutic
     interventions when indicated.
     Indications
     ERCP indications include obstructive jaundice, biliary or pancreatic
     ductal system disease treatment or tissue sampling, suspicion for
     pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis of unknown cause, manometry for
     sphincter of Oddi, nasobiliary drainage, biliary stenting for
     strictures and leakage, drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, and
     balloon dilation of the duodenal papilla and ductal strictures.
     Sphincterotomy is indicated in cases of the sphincter of Oddi
     dysfunction or stenosis, difficulty with biliary stenting or
     accessing the pancreatic duct, biliary strictures, bile duct stones,
     bile sump syndrome following choledochoduodenostomy, choledochocele,
     and in poor surgical candidates with ampullary carcinoma.

     Pancreatic necrosectomy

     Pancreatic necrosectomy is the surgical procedure used in the
     management of acute necrotising pancreatitis, a condition
     characterised by the inflammation of the pancreas.

     The primary indication for performing a pancreatic necrosectomy,
     whether it be open or laparoscopic, is the presence of infected
     pancreatic necrosis. It can also be performed in the case of sterile
     pancreatic necrosis with associated deterioration of the patient’s
     clinical status.


Q2. A 55yr old male patient with diabetes since 7 yrs presented with c/
o vomitings since 1 day(20 episodes non projectile and bilious) with right
sided weakness and headache since 1 day .3 yrs back he had right sided weakness

   1. Please go through the cranial MR images of the patient and comment on
      which cerebral territories are involved. (3)
   2. What is the role of MR angio in further diagnosis? Will you advice it for
      this patient? (2)
   3. What is the role of cerebral vessel stenting in this patient? Please
      review the literature on its evidence and share it in the PICO format.(2)

First responder answers 

a.H/o right sided weakness with memory impairment- left MCA
Left medial rectus palsy - 3rd cranial nerve
Absent sensation over left half of face - 5th nerve
Scanning speech - cerebellum
Vomitings +
PICA territory - lateral medullary syndrome ?
Dementia due to temporal lobe involvement :MCA territory infarct
Behavioural abnormalities , depression,apathy , dyskinesia would help in
further localising

Assessor's queries/inputs: How would depression apathy help in localizing? 
Dementia due to temporal lobe? 

b. B- Bilateral MCA infarct 
With Right  PICA infarct 

Assessor's inputs/queries: What anatomical areas are involved that are supplied
by MCA and PICA 


c) In the setting of acute stroke, MRA is useful for determining the severity
of stenosis, vascular occlusion, and collateral flow. CE MRA and 3D TOF
techniques have relatively high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating
surgical from nonsurgical carotid stenoses. Three-dimensional TOF MRA is quite
sensitive and specific for the evaluation of intracranial proximal stenoses and
occlusions. Two-dimensional PC MRA is useful for determining collateral flow
patterns in the circle of Willis. MRA is also useful in the determination of
stroke etiologies such as dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, and
moya moya. Currently, MRA is relatively insensitive to the detection of
stenoses in distal intracranial vessels but this detection will improve with
new MR hardware and software.
No I will not advise for this patient .

than one line from that link 


Short notes:

   1. Multiple infarct dementia (3)

First responder:

multiple infarct dementia is also called as vasular infarct
Vascular dementia is widely considered the second most common cause of dementia
after Alzheimer's disease, accounting for 5 percent to 10 percent of cases.
Symptoms include: 
Confusion
Disorientation
Trouble speaking or understanding speech
Physical stroke symptoms, such as a
sudden headache
Difficulty walking
Poor balance
Numbness or paralysis on one side of the face or the body
Controlling risk factors that may increase the likelihood of further damage to
the
brain’s blood vessels is an important treatment strategy

The next day’s chest X ray (image link) reveals bilateral moderate pleural
effusion with loss of the previous alveolar opacities

What is your morphological and etiological differential diagnosis for this
patient? (2)

First responder:


Differential daignosis : community acquired pneumonia:
Viral /bacterial /fungal / atypical .
Right sided pneumonia with subsequent ARDS
M/c/c cause of viral pneumonia- influenza
Bacterial- streptococcus pneumoniae
Gram negative- H.influenzae

How would you proceed to manage this patient if you suspect that there could be
an infectious etiology? (6)

First responder:


According to AIIMS 2019 guidelines :
Pneumonia leading to ICU admission
Antibiotic of choice is beta lactams+ macrolides preferred than beta lactams
plus fluoroqunilones

As there are no structural lesions of lung,aspiration history ,old age , no
need of psuedomonal and aneraobic coverage

How would you prevent contagion? (2)

First responder:

Wearing mask 
Isolation of patient 
Hand wash techniques after touching patient

      Intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antiemetics are the basic

      Weber's syndrome, also known as superior alternating hemiplegia, is a
      form of stroke characterized by the presence of an ipsilateral oculomotor
      nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia
      There is a multitude of etiologies that can lead to a stroke. Some of the
      most common risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
      hypercholesterolemia, physical inactivity, obesity, genetics, and
      smoking. Cerebral emboli commonly originate from the heart, especially in
      patients with preexisting heart arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation),
      valvular disease, structural defects (atrial and ventricular septal
      defects) and chronic rheumatic heart disease. Emboli may lodge in areas
      of preexisting stenosis.[3] Alcohol intake has a J-shaped relationship
      with ischemic stroke. Mild to moderate drinking carries a slightly lower
      risk of ischemic stroke yet heavier drinking increases the risk
      drastically. Alcohol intake increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in a
      near linear relationship.

      Strokes that occur in small vessels(lacunar infarcts) are most commonly
      caused by chronic, uncontrolled hypertension resulting in the
      pathological entity of lipohyalinosis and arteriolosclerosis. These
      strokes occur in the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, and pons.
      Uncontrolled hypertension in these areas can also lead to hypertensive
      intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH).[4]

      About 15% of all strokes are classified as hemorrhagic, with the etiology
      being the most commonly uncontrolled hypertension. Other causes of
      hemorrhagic strokes include cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a disease in
      which amyloid plaques deposit in small and medium vessels, which causes
      vessels to become rigid and more vulnerable to tears. Deposition can
      occur anywhere, but they occur most commonly on the surfaces of the
      frontal and parietal lobes. The structural integrity of vessels is
      another important consideration in hemorrhagic stroke etiology, with
      aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations,
      capillary telangiectasias, venous angiomas, and vasculitis being more
      common reasons for stroke.[5]

      SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)

      Cause
      SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) – virus identified in 2003. SARS-CoV is
      thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir,
      perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first
      infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002.

      Transmission
      An epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000
      cases in 2003. Since then, a small number of cases have occurred as a
      result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through animal-to-human
      transmission (Guangdong, China).

      Transmission of SARS-CoV is primarily from person to person. It appears
      to have occurred mainly during the second week of illness, which
      corresponds to the peak of virus excretion in respiratory secretions and
      stool, and when cases with severe disease start to deteriorate
      clinically. Most cases of human-to-human transmission occurred in the
      health care setting, in the absence of adequate infection control
      precautions. Implementation of appropriate infection control practices
      brought the global outbreak to an end.

      Nature of the disease
      Symptoms are influenza-like and include fever, malaise, myalgia,
      headache, diarrhoea, and shivering (rigors). No individual symptom or
      cluster of symptoms has proved to be specific for a diagnosis of SARS.
      Although fever is the most frequently reported symptom, it is sometimes
      absent on initial measurement, especially in elderly and immunosuppressed
      patients.

      Cough (initially dry), shortness of breath, and diarrhoea are present in
      the first and/or second week of illness. Severe cases often evolve
      rapidly, progressing to respiratory distress and requiring intensive
      care.

      Geographical distribution
      The distribution is based on the 2002–2003 epidemic. The disease appeared
      in November 2002 in the Guangdong province of southern China. This area
      is considered as a potential zone of re-emergence of SARS-CoV.

      Other countries/areas in which chains of human-to-human transmission
      occurred after early importation of cases were Toronto in Canada, Hong
      Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Chinese Taipei, Singapore,
      and Hanoi in Viet Nam.

      Risk for travellers
      Currently, no areas of the world are reporting transmission of SARS.
      Since the end of the global epidemic in July 2003, SARS has reappeared
      four times – three times from laboratory accidents (Singapore and Chinese
      Taipei), and once in southern China where the source of infection remains
      undetermined although there is circumstantial evidence of animal-to-human
      transmission.

      Should SARS re-emerge in epidemic form, WHO will provide guidance on the
      risk of travel to affected areas. Travellers should stay informed about
      current travel recommendations. However, even during the height of the
      2003 epidemic, the overall risk of SARS-CoV transmission to travellers
      was low.

      Prophylaxis

      None. Experimental vaccines are under development.

      Precautions
      Follow any travel recommendations and health advice issued by WHO.

      We did a trial run now with Dr Rashmita and Dr Ajit and it's possible
      that directly posting to the blog can sometimes cause errors and the
      message may not go through. So as a back up please also send it to my
      email address shared above.

      Those students who were absent in the exam hall, please ensure that you
      complete your answers and post it online by Monday 👍

      Few of you have shared your handwritten versions and while the only
      original content in them is your handwriting which we appreciate, it's
      much more easier for us to assess and share if we can get those in a
      typed version.

      I know all of you love your handwriting practice but at least once in two
      weeks you can have some typing practice too. 👍

      Thanks to those who have begun uploading your answers online and or
      shared them in email.

      Can you paste the question before your answers as otherwise it's
      difficult to sort them out and also difficult to guage which questions
      you have left out especially if you have done your own numbering (for
      example you may have used 1,2,3...for a, b, c...in the original question?

      Please share the reference link when you share generic information such
      as in short notes.

      For example when you share the short note below:

      "Pancreatic pseudocyst:

      Pancreatic pseudocysts can be described as fluid-filled cavities arising
      from the pancreas and surrounded by a wall of fibrous or inflammatory
      tissue, but lacking an epithelial cover.

      Most common after chronic pancreatitis than acute pancreatitis..." we
      realize this is text book knowledge but it would be nice to have a
      reference to the text book with page numbers along with an online link to
      it.

      Please check below an example on how text book information is cited and
      referenced:

      "Example: Chapter in an Edited Book

      In-Text Citation (Quotation):

      (Stewart, 2007, p. 102)

      References:

      Stewart, B. (2007). Chapter title... "Pancreatic pseudocyst" In J.
      Jaimeson, T. Bannerman, & S. Wong (Eds.), Pancreatic disorders (pp. 97-
      105). Toronto, Canada: university Press." (Online link)

      The above was just an example to also make you learn to cite references
      as it will become important for you all to write papers (once you begin
      working on projects that can run parallel to your thesis). 👍

      The above reference example was modified with apologies from this link

      Other than the above there can be some scope for originality too in your
      online submitted answer paper if you can add to the questions around the
      patients, add to the history and clinical findings and add more questions
      around the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties in these three
      patients.

      Lastly we are looking forward to your submitting some different patients
      with different medical issues in a similar question format that will if
      good enough become automatically be selected for the next fortnightly
      exam.

      Once we make this a regular project and publish and share it with the
      university there may be enough traction for them to adopt this
      methodology even for the finals 👍

      Assessor's inputs on the answers in general (hoping not to sound too
      patronizing):

      A large volume of copy paste that will be construed as plagiarism when
      shared online. However this is a transition phase where our students are
      learning to realize how copy pasting from memory (aka paraphrasing in
      one's own words after internalizing) is not the same as copy pasting
      directly from one online location to another although both are similar in
      some ways. We shall be able to quickly grow out of this phase I am sure
      with a little more persistence.
