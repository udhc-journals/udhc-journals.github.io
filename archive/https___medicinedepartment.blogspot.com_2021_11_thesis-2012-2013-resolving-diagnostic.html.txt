**** Thesis 2012-2013 Resolving diagnostic uncertainty in fever patients using
fever and symptom pattern recognition by Dr Himanshu Jain, Bhopal ****
 TITLE:   Minimizing Antibiotic Usage for Poorly localizable fevers of short
duration in Adults using a Check List and Temperature Monitoring.
****** PLACE OF STUDY: The study was conducted in Medicine, Peoples Hospital,
PCMS & RC, Bhopal, M.P. ******
****** STUDY DESIGN – It was Prospective Observational Study. ******
****** STUDY PERIOD – over one year ******
SAMPLE SIZE - 500 patients
SAMPLE POPULATION -Patients of age 14-50 yrs attending Medicine Department in
PCMS & RC, Bhanpur, Bhopal.

INCLUSION CRITERIA:
   1. ****** Written informed consent from each patient or legal guardian prior
      to enrollment. ******
   2. Patients Age 14 to 50 years
   3. Recent-onset fever (within one to five days) when the diagnostic
      uncertainty is high.
   4. Symptoms commonly suggestive of self-limiting flu like illnesses such as
      myalgia, arthralgia with commonly known symptoms indicating involvement
      of upper respiratory tract such as cough, rhinorrhoea, frontal headache
      etc. 

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
   1. Obvious clinical localization for fever such as pneumonia, meningitis,
      urinary tract infection etc.
   2. Clinical diagnosis suggesting important clinical localizations such as
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascitis.
   3. Elderly, underlying immunosuppression or any associated conditions
      predisposing to severe infections such as diabetes.

CONSENT: 
Written and informed consent in local language was obtained prior to enrollment
in study.
ETHICAL APPROVAL: 
Institutional Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from Institutional
Ethics Committee at Peoples Hospital, Barkatullah University, Bhopal.
METHOD OF STUDY:
Five hundred clinically matched patients over one year presenting with recent-
onset fever to the Peoples Hospital PCMS & RC, Bhopal, was prospectively
monitored for fever, duration of illness and satisfaction levels. 
In fever patients presenting to PCMS&RC we had used a check list to allocate
suitable patients to just antipyretics and/or antibiotics and temperature
charting for 2 days (extended to 4 days if fever persists but lesser number of
fever episodes per day and temperature spikes <1030F) and study their health
care outcomes. After monitoring for two days if the fever shows a progression
only then antibiotics been instituted. (depending on the judgment of the
treating physician). 
Two groups were studied:
Group A – 
This group comprise of patients encountered by investigators (not blinded to
the patient’s inclusion status in the study), they waited two days before
taking a decision on antibiotics after selecting patients for the above on the
basis of inclusion criteria and continue to encourage monitoring of their fever
patterns over two days. 
Group B – 
This group comprise of patients encountered by Physicians delivering their
usual care for fever (as per their prevailing clinical judgment). They remained
blinded to the patient’s status in the study.
Patient’s recruitment was done through OPD attender from OPD and was
alternately allocated in each group. Patients been recruited such that to cover
all seasons in a year. OPD Patients were advised Temperature charting 8 hourly
and also during fever episodes for 2 days (duration been extended for 4 days if
fever persists but with lesser number of fever episodes per day and temperature
spikes <1030F). Patients who were admitted in hospital, their temperature been
monitored by patient itself or by his/her relative or by nursing staff. 
Patient reviewed after 2 days by personal appearance or Phone call for follow
up about temperature charting, fever pattern, duration of illness/time to
recovery, events inbetween two days if any, check list score and satisfaction
level on VAS. A Check List being provided for deciding whether to use
antibiotic or not during the course of illness or to explain whether Antibiotic
need was there or not. VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) being used before and after
the illness to access the satisfaction level of Patient’s. Patient was advised
to report immediately for any urgent need.

STUDY TOOLS –
   1. Mercury Thermometer.
   2. Check List.
   3. VAS (Visual Analogue Scale)
             
                          CHECK LIST

    * Neck pain/Neck stiffness                                          0 1





VISUAL ANALOUGE SCALE (VAS) – 

A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure
a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of
values and cannot easily be directly measured.

current health.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
Statistical analysis were done using SPSS software version 20. Average/median
duration of fever will be ascertained. Dispersion in terms of range and
standard deviation will be calculated. Antibiotic/ antipyretics consumptions
will be associated/correlated by duration of fever by using Student T-test, and
patient satisfaction through Mann-Whitney Test and appropriate statistical
test.
