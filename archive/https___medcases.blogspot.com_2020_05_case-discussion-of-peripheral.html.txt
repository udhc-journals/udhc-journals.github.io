Case_discussion

[29/05/20, 8:48:46 PM] Student1: What is the reason for norwegian scabies in
this case? And since he tested negative for all.
[29/05/20, 8:50:27 PM] Post Residency PG1: What is the difference between
ordinary scabies and Norwegian and which one did he have?
[29/05/20, 8:51:08 PM] Student2: He had Norwegian scabies sir. It's more likely
as he didn't feel any itching sensation
[29/05/20, 8:51:46 PM] Student2: Which is characteristic in Norwegian.¬†
And it's also more likely to pict in immunosupressed persons
[29/05/20, 8:51:59 PM] Student2: Which he is, due to his regular alcohol
consumption
[29/05/20, 8:54:27 PM] PG1: The patient had itching previously but then he got
permithrin application done before he has come to our hospital .
May be he scabies got healed partly and he had no itching.
[29/05/20, 8:59:52 PM] Student1: Yeah that could be possible
[29/05/20, 9:00:25 PM] Post Residency PG1: Can you share some literature links
and quote the relevant portion?
[29/05/20, 9:00:26 PM] Student1: Okay. So since how long did he have scabies?
[29/05/20, 9:06:01 PM] Post Residency PG1: üëçBetter to share the link and quote
the text
[29/05/20, 9:07:30 PM] Student2: https://www.medicinenet.com/
what_is_norwegian_scabies/views.htm.¬† ¬†¬†

"Crusted scabies almost always affects people with a compromised immune system"

"Interestingly, itching maybe absent or minimal in this form of scabies.
