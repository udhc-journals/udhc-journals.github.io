MEDICINE DEPARTMENT:

   1. Research Undertaken

   1. Objectives of research being undertaken :

Objectives:
1) Answering multidimensional information needs in individual patients and health professionals Â utilizing available IT and AI (case based reasoning) toolsÂ 
2) Integrating medical education and practiceÂ 
3)Â Developing a health care blended-learning ecosystem through a network of global multiple learner stakeholders that includes medical student and health professionals from diverse disciplines catering to
patients along with their relatives in rural and urban India so that they may benefit from this global learning toward their local caring.Â 
4) Optimization of healthcare costs in a manner that can still provide highest quality of care in low resource settings.Â
