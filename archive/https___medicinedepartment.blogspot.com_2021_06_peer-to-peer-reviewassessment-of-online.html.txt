**** Peer to peer review/assessment of Online assignments in E logged learning
portfolios exposes student plagiarism shortcomings ****
Unfortunately in our soon to be past (and largely current) offline system of
medical education system we inadvertently reward students for stealing by
giving the best marks in theory answer papers to the best copy pasted answers
from memorized text books thus encouraging a hitherto unrecognized form of
plagiarism but the real world of 'virtual shared learning' cannot tolerate
sharing of unoriginal work.Â 
Conversational instructions from Faculty Coordinator FC to each student for
peer to peer assessment of their monthly assignment for online summative
assessment--
(For more about conversational learning check out the reference links below)Â 

"We are planning to start a peer to peer assessment of all the assignments for
the month of May by some/all of you as assessors.Â 


More about the process here :https://teaching.cornell.edu/spring-teaching-
resources/assessment-evaluation/peer-assessment


Will get one student to assess the answers to one question for all the
batchmates answers shared here :Â https://onlineassessmentmay.blogspot.com/2021/
06/online-assessment-may.htmlÂ and provide inputs on tentative marks based on a
standard answer.Â 


Let me know which question you would like to assess for all of your batchmates

[6/11, 7:41 AM] 1st Peer assessor 2017 batch : Okay sir I would like to do
question no. 1


[6/11, 7:45 AM] 1st Peer assessor 2017 batch

: Sir for how many marks am I evaluating each question?


[6/11, 7:45 AM]Â  Faculty Coordinator FC : Will be looking forward to one sample
review of one question asap.Â 


One question is 10 marks


[6/11, 7:48 AM] 1st Peer assessor 2017 batch

: 1) for roll no. "n" for that question I would like to give a 9 sir. She has
given beautiful illustrative pictures for a better understanding. Also all her
answers are correct with proper explanation and images.


[6/11, 7:49 AM] Faculty Coordinator FCÂ 

: Are you sure they are her original answers and there is no plagiarism? ðŸ¤”


[6/11, 7:50 AM] 1st Peer assessor 2017 batch

: Yes sir, it seems original


[6/11, 7:55 AM] Faculty Coordinator FCÂ 

: What about answer 5? She has borrowed an image from some online resource
without acknowledging it? What if someone sues her for copyright?


[6/11, 7:55 AM] Peer assessor 2017 batch

: Yes sir thatâ€™s true

[6/11, 7:55 AM] Peer assessor 2017 batch

: All her images are from online


[6/11, 7:59 AM] Faculty Coordinator FCÂ 

: That would be plagiarism unless she acknowledges them adequately and adds
disclaimers about her uncertainty of their copyright issues promising to remove
them if anyone objects?


[6/11, 8:01 AM] Faculty Coordinator FCÂ 

: But even with a disclaimer how can one be sure that one isn't infringing
copyright?Â 


Also what is the evidence for what is displayed in those images? How can we
take the images at face value unless they are supported with adequate data
driven evidence?


[6/11, 8:02 AM] 1st Peer assessor 2017 batch

: Yes sir thatâ€™s there
