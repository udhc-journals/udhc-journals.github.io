**** Dissertation plan activity with post graduate students from all
departments ****
Going by our learning from past experience in the thesis committee, this time
we need to ensure that their thesis topic selection:

a) contains a proper problem statement, study design and expected outcomes and
finally a title, which reflects all of that.

b) serves as a valuable tool to solve patient problems that the students
encounter in their regular workflow 

c) enables them to develop different publishable findings from their thesis 

 d) does not become a burden on them making them resort to unethical
practices. 

We are looking forward to developing the thesis topics of this current first
year batch through a blended discussion with each one of them along with their
esteemed faculty before it becomes too late for their protocol submission.

We have asked each thesis protocol going candidate to 
start sharing their initial thoughts on their own thesis plan in the online
whatsapp group created specially for that purpose and encouraged them to just
share enough that can be easily read in a text message and we shall
collectively try to build on it conversationally. 

One of the problems with whatsapp conversations is that there is currently no
scope to create a separate thread for each one of their thesis. 

To circumvent that we are asking them to put their preliminary thoughts into
their blog and share the link and paste it with each one of their messages and
keep adding the related conversations to it so that all the inputs related to
their thesis gets archived in their own blog. 


The blog post here is a quick demo to produce a link that can be emulated by
them in their text messages.

            The first step to selecting your topic, also to ensure you get
            adequate cases is to reflect on what problems you have encountered
            during your regular workflow and then prepare your problem
            statement with it.

            We can help you in this process if you can share the frequent
            problems in your day to day workflow that you have encountered till
            now after you joined.

            You can also google "dissertation problem statement" to get a
            better overview of how to write one yourself

      Peripheral perfusion index measured by pulse oxymeter as a predictor of
      developing shock in children of age 1mo to 12years. Is that the right way
      to put forward the question?

            This appears to be a title for your thesis.

            What we need to know clearly is what problem will this be able to
            solve and how impactful it will be.

            How would you measure the peripheral perfusion index? How will it
            be useful as a predictor?

            The answers to these questions can come into the introduction of
            your problem statement.
