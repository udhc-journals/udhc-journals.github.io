**** Case discussion on myocarditis ****
THIS IS AN ACTIVE CASE DISCUSSION RELATED TO MYOCARDITIS

Details of the case are present in the following link https://
madhur116.blogspot.com/2020/05/on-1452020.html?m=1and my analysis of the case
is present in the following linkhttps://medcases.blogspot.com/2020/05/heart-
failure.html

Case_discussion

[30/05/20, 4:22:19 PM] Student7: 
Few doubts i got while writing the case:
1.Is the mitral regurgitation in this case secondary to left ventricular
dysfunction or is it the regurgitant valvular disease that is causing the heart
failure?
2.What are the long term complications of using diuretics?
[30/05/20, 4:32:57 PM] Student23: Mitral regurgitation in this case is due to
left ventricular dilatation (which is due viral myocarditis) which stretches
the mitral valve anulus causing valvular insufficiency
[30/05/20, 4:33:16 PM] Student23: https://www.cardiomyopathy.org/news--media/
latest-news/post/420-mitral-valve-regurgitation
[30/05/20, 4:39:17 PM] Student7: 
[30/05/20, 4:46:42 PM] Student24: Regarding your question 2.
"The most worrisome effects of diuretic therapy have revolved around
hypokalemia and its relationship to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death."
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/01.HYP.11.3_Pt_2.II16
[30/05/20, 5:07:34 PM] Post Residency PG1: What is the evidence that she has
mitral regurgitation?
[30/05/20, 5:07:50 PM] Post Residency PG1: Ask the treating team to share her
Echo video

[30/05/20, 6:23:13 PM] Student1: Things which I did not understand in this case
are:
1)Why was Anti-malarial drug prescribed for him if it was a simple viral fever?
Why not Paracetamol/ Ibuprofen?
2)What were his auscultatory findings?
[30/05/20, 8:19:14 PM] Post Residency PG1: 1) unfortunately people are
prescribing it for the big virus troubling mankind the most now 

2) We have the patient's number if any of you can help us take a better
history. Also the auscultation point is giving me an idea. Can we collect the
patient's heart sounds also through his mobile phone by asking him to place it
in different locations of his chest?
[30/05/20, 8:25:00 PM] Student1: Sir there are studies which say that
Chloroquine can cause cardiomyopathy. So could that be possible in this case?
Assuming he was prescribed chloroquine.
[30/05/20, 8:26:00 PM] Student2: He was prescribed Choloquine according to a PG
Maam.
[30/05/20, 8:26:45 PM] Student1: Okay. So could that be the cause?
[30/05/20, 9:31:25 PM] Post Residency PG1: Share one such study
[30/05/20, 9:32:04 PM] Post Residency PG1: Quote the relevant portion
[30/05/20, 9:38:18 PM] Post Residency PG1: There are no numbers here. How many
patients received chloroquin? How many developed cardiomyopathy? Need more
study details
[30/05/20, 9:43:29 PM] Student1: Fewer than 20 cases of chloroquine
cardiomyopathy have been reported. In our case, we observed an association
between two cardiac complications of chloroquine toxicity: conduction disorder
and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This pathology has been
[30/05/20, 9:43:42 PM] Student1: https://heart.bmj.com/content/81/2/221
[30/05/20, 10:05:21 PM] Post Residency PG1: Is this a quote from the link
below? 
[30/05/20, 10:48:49 PM] Student1: Yes sir
[30/05/20, 10:52:08 PM] Post Residency PG1: Does our case fit with the case
described here?
[30/05/20, 11:02:16 PM] Student1: No sir it mainly shows the long term effects
of chloroquine
[30/05/20, 11:04:39 PM] Post Residency PG1: Will be looking forward to your
finding a chloroquin study that demonstrates acute cardiac damage similar to
what our patient had. Any takers for direct history taking in this patient
through telephone including his mobile phone auscultation data?
[31/05/20, 12:15:34 AM] Student1: I will find it out sir.

[31/05/20, 8:18:04 AM] Student2: https://caseopinionsbyrollno156.blogspot.com/
2020/05/fighting-for-breath.html

Some doubts: 

1.What was the dosage of Chlorquine given to him? What was the treatment he
recieved for improvement from Grade 3 NYHA to grade 2?

2. Why is there presence of early inspiratory crepts in this patient with
pleural effusion, when early inspirtaoy crepts indicate Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disorders?

3. Why did pleural effusion occur and not pulmonary edema when mechanism of
rise of backflow pressures from left atrium is the same in both?

4. Why was no chest X-ray taken to better understand the lung pathology?

5. How was a severe Mitral reguritation hidden? There was no systloic murmur
neither any characteristic ECG changes?
[31/05/20, 9:08:30 AM] Post Residency PG1: These are excellent questions Dr Sri
Valli. 

Let all the students share their answers and please ask the CR to share it with
all the interns and PGs. Once there is a discussion I shall provide all the
answers. 

The first question around dose can be also answered by the patient. Let me know
if you want to ask him and I shall PM you his number. 

One of the major deficits in our Intern logged history (and I'm sure it will be
the same for most of our students UG and PG) is that the entire story of the
patient is hardly ever captured and there always remain gaps. 

So informational continuity with the patient is very important.
[31/05/20, 10:28:36 AM] Student2: Yes sure sir. Please send me his number.
[31/05/20, 12:25:55 PM] Post Residency PG1: Have shared his number with three
of you. Please be empathetic with him. First introduce yourself as a student
doctor working in our department as a member of our team and then gently ask
him the questions like a doctor (not like a policeman).

This is actually the most important test of your online training. Let's hope we
shall be able to benefit him and our group shall derive more learning insights
about him from your inquiries
