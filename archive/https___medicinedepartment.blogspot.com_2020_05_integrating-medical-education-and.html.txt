**** Integrating Medical education and practice: Online real patient data
stimulating active learning in medical students ****
General  Medicine online classes for Final MBBS part – II students are being
 conducted through two formats.

One is a passive learning format where PPTs or lecture videos done by our
faculty are shared through a schoology portal and then MCQs are provided with
auto correct generation of content recall testing.

The other format is an attempt at active learning with students on social
media, centered around their Elog books (Online learning portfolio) where
students are provided a clinical problem to solve and then encouraged to raise
questions around the case and search and discuss the answers with Faculty and
other senior students.

This week we have begun our online learning session

with the UGs around

the topic of

"Patient data analysis"

with a

Target competency:

to develop an ability/competency to read and comprehend a patient's history,
examination findings, investigations and analyze it in a manner to understand
the patient's requirements around his/her diagnosis and treatment.

Methodology:

The students competency will be assessed by their ability to form a problem
list in order of the patient's priority for which they need to get in touch
with the original creator of the online patient's record and then from each
problem in the list they would need to analyze the cause of the problem and
come to a diagnosis and therapeutic plan for the patient that will be vetted as
useful by the entire general medicine online learning ecosystem that includes,
interns, Pgs, faculty locally as well as globally including the online patient
himself/herself.

Below is the link to all 200 online learning logs made by the current 8th
semester students:

And here are some special sample logs from a few students who were the early
birds in this online active learning session where majority of their cognitive
 activity is in pm conversation with the session moderator and is reflected in
the comments section of their log book.

This is a student log where an active learning cross consultation was obtained
from another department and added to the student's log book comment box that
reflects his her active conversational learning

All the interns and PGs in the department of Medicine have been informed about
this exercise and the student E logs have been made available for them to
participate in this active online learning activity that will be hopefully
reflected in the comments section of the student's E logs following which the
students shall receive formative assessment score based on a percentile once we
check out the student log with the maximum number of learning points that can
serve as the current highest comparator.

Maybe chat bots will soon take over the active learning and assessment part of
the overall workflow?
