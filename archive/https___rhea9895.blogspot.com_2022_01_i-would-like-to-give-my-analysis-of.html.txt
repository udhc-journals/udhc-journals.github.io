 _January_19,_2022_
I would like to give my analysis of the below mentioned blog made by Dr. K.
Vaishnavi ma'am with respect to my bimonthly blended assignemnt.
https://karnativaishnavi.blogspot.com/2021/08/cushings-syndrome.html?m=1
My analysis is mainly with respect to the following aspects:-
1. What is the evidence of topical preparations of glucocorticoids causing
Cushing's syndrome? Is it more as compared to oral or similar? Do other modes
of administration have the same effects?
2. Evidence of the laboratory investigations used in the diagnosis of Cushing's
syndrome.
3. Efficacy of the therapeutic interventions mentioned for this patient?

Addressing_the_1st_issue-
1. In this patient, order of priority of his problems according to me are as
follows:
    * Itchy, ring like lesions over trunk, arms, thigh and groin since 1 year
    * Purplish stretch marks over abdomen, limbs since 1 year
    * Facial puffiness and weight gain
    * Feeling low, not talking to anyone 
    * Low back ache
    * Pedal edema 
    * Loss of libido, erectile dysfunction
All his findings are classic of CUSHING'S SYNDROME.

A) Itchy ring like lesions over trunk, arms, thigh and groin: Suggestive of
TINEA CORPORIS ET CRURIS

After going through the detailed analysis of the above mentioned blog, I think
that this is the most important problem because this was the reason why he
developed CUSHING'S SYNDROME in the first place.

He used CLOBETASOL OINTMENT over these lesions for approximately 1 year.

"The risk increases based on factors that include glucocorticoid potency
(see Table_I), the amount applied (affected body surface area is a surrogate
measure), skin thickness and location (with eyelid and scrotum showing most
penetration and the side of the foot the least), the presence of broken skin,
the age of the patient (children have increased absorption), the use of
occlusive dressings (which promote absorption), the type of vehicle (ointments
increase penetration), and the duration of use. Cushing’s syndrome has been
reported most often in infants receiving a class 1 agent (usually clobetasol)"

Although low doses of over-the-counter topical glucocorticoids are used
commonly and safely, it is known that systemic absorption of steroids from
topical preparations does occur and that at higher doses or with more potent
preparations both adrenal axis suppression and Cushing’s syndrome can occur.
"https://www.saem.org.ar/departamentos/departamento-neuroendocrinologia/
cushing-exogeno.pdf"
"It is now clear that significant systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids
can be seen, although fewer than with equivalent oral doses. These effects are
dose-related and come in the form of adrenal suppression and Cushingoid
stigmata, particularly bone, ocular, and skin manifestations."
B) Feeling low, not feeling like talking to anyone- suggestive of depression
Depression, mood dysregulation, sleep disturbance and cognitive abnormalities
are also observed in Cushing’s syndrome. The rates for each of these symptoms
vary widely across studies. Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric
disturbance in Cushing’s syndrome. A major depressive syndrome is seen in
50%–70% of the cases. Other associated features include anxiety in 12%–79% of
the cases, as well as a rate of 3% for hypomania. Less common are features of
psychosis and mania.
"Glucocorticoid signalling insufficiency hypothesis suggests that
hypercortisolaemia is an attempt to overcome primary glucocorticoid receptor
resistance related to down-regulated glucocorticoid receptors. In contrast, the
glucocorticoid signalling overactivity hypothesis for depression suggests there
is overall increased net signalling via the glucocorticoid receptor. Changes in
cortisol activity leading to decreased serotonin and increased dopamine
cerebral activity have also been described."

Addressing_the_2nd_issue:
The following study was done to check for the sensitivity of SLEEPING MIDNIGHT
CORSTISOL in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8548938/
"The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity in the diagnosis of
Cushing's syndrome of a single in-patient sleeping midnight cortisol to a
standard 48-hour in-patient low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST)
during the same admission.
In this series of 150 cases, a single in-patient sleeping midnight cortisol
above 50 nmol/l had a 100% sensitivity for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome,
clearly different from normal subjects. In contrast, the low-dose dexamethasone
suppression test had a sensitivity of 98% even when the drug was administered
as an in-patient. We recommend that a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
should not be used alone for confirmation of Cushing's syndrome since it may
miss 2% of cases."
Efficacy of various investigations in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome:

Addressing_the_3rd_issue-
The patient in our case received:
    * TAB. HISONE
    * INJ. HYDROCORTISONE (in cases of adrenal crisis)
Treatment of exogenous cushing's syndrome is to decrease and eventually stop
taking any corticosteroids which was also done in our patient. Suddenly
stopping corticosteroids after taking them for a long time (usually more than 2
weeks) can result in a life-threatening condition called adrenal crisis.
Inspite of tapering the dose of medication, his symptoms did not subside.
Therefore, a probability of DOUBLE CUSHING'S SYNDROME was suspected. Though it
is a very rare diagnosis, it should be considered in patients whose Cushing's
syndrome related symptms do not subside even after stopping the steroid
medication.
I would suggest that our patient should undergo the following workup in case
there is an endogenous Cushing's syndrome.
