1) A 55 year old man with Recurrent Focal Seizures Detailedpatientca report
here:  http://ushaindurthi. blogspot.com/2020/11/55-year- old-male-with-
complaints-of. html 1. What is the problem representation of this patient and
what could be the anatomical site of lesion ? A 55 year old male construction
worker with T2DM who is a chronic alcoholic & smoker came with c/o weakness of
right upper limb with involuntary movements of both right UL & LL secondary to
? right temporal lobe epileptogenic focus. 2. Why are subcortical internal
capsular infarcts more common that cortical infarcts? subcortical infarcts are
caused by occlusion of a penetrating artery from a large cerebral artery, most
commonly from the Circle of Willis. These penetrating arteries arise at sharp
angles from major vessels and are thus, anatomically prone to constriction and
occlusion.  So subcortical infarcts are more common than cortical infarcts.
