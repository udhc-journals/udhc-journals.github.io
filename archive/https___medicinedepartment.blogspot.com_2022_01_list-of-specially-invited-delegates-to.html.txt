**** List of specially invited delegates to the 2022 Clinical Problem Solving
conference ****
Dear Dr, This is to welcome you as a specially invited delegate in the 2022
clinical problem solving conference in view of your past competencies,
demonstrated interest and future potential for scholarship and leadership in
this area (also evidenced by your published online learning portfolio linked
below). 

It's possible that we have overlooked and missed other students whose talents
have been invisible to us for some reason and we hope we shall be able to
discover more such talents in the near future. 

Three of you have also been invited in the additional capacity of a 
vocalist musician before each session.

As a delegate you receive a certificate and a delegate badge along with the
usual conference food. 


best,
