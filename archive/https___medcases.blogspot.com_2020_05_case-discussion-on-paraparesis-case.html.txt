Case_discussion

[29/05/20, 8:38:56 PM] Student16: 1.WHAT IS THE REASON FOR 
Elevated Liver enzymes and reduced Creatinine and Lymphocytes ;
Frequent Change of Position recommended to the patient ;
Rt sided reflexes being more pronounced than left sided ? Does is have anything
to do with Lt sided enhancement being more than Rt side in the MRI as pyramidal
tracts cross-over at lower medulla ?
2. WHEN HE FELL, DID HE JUST FALL BECAUSE HIS LEGS WERE WEAK / HE LOST HIS
BALANCE / HE BECAME UNCONSCIOUS ?
[29/05/20, 8:40:09 PM] Student16: 1. HAS ELEVATED LEVELS OF COMPONENTS IN RFT,
OUT OF WHICH FEW ELEVATIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED w.r.t THE CORTICOSTEROID THERAPY
AND SALICYLATE THERAPY, OTHERS ARE NOT. ALBUMIN IS SEEN IN URINE, COULD THE PT
HAVE CHRONIC RENAL PATHOLOGY ?
2. CHANGE IN MUSCLE WEAKNESS w.r.t TEMPERATURE ?
3.HOW LONG HAS THE NON PITTING B/L LL EDEMA BEEN THERE ? DID IT CHANGE TO NON-
PITTING TYPE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME?
4. 2 YEARS IS A LONG TIME, DID THE PATIENT NOT SEE ANY OTHER PHYSICIAN ?
RELEVANT DRUG HISTORY WHICH MIGHT HELP ?
COULD HE BE PRONE TO DIABETES ?
COULD THE REASON FOR B/L NON PITTING LL EDEMA BE MUSCULAR WEAKNESS WHICH LEADS
TO DECREASED VENOUS RETURN AND VENOUS STASIS, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME CAUSING
FIBROSIS ?
[29/05/20, 8:49:26 PM] Post Residency PG1: 

Someone please attempt to answer these. Have you shared these with the treating
team members? 

Hope all of you have their Whatsapp numbers?
[29/05/20, 8:50:59 PM] Student1: I think frequent change of position is due to
the abscess he has
[29/05/20, 8:58:45 PM] Post Residency PG1: Abscess where? The treating intern
blog should have shared an image
[29/05/20, 8:59:10 PM] Student1: Gluteal abscess sir
[29/05/20, 9:01:32 PM] Post Residency PG1: That patient was 23M and this one is
18M?
[29/05/20, 9:02:27 PM] Student1: 23 M sir
[29/05/20, 9:05:03 PM] Post Residency PG1: 
[29/05/20, 10:09:46 PM] Student17: http://durgamahadev118.blogspot.com/2020/05/
gm-paraparesis-case-of-23yr-old-elog.html

My questions r in this log book
[29/05/20, 10:44:24 PM] Student18: 1 : Change of position may be due to pain
due to abscess. So frequent change in position may give him relief
[29/05/20, 10:49:33 PM] Student19: What is the cause for non projectile
vomiting .?
[29/05/20, 10:50:47 PM] Student11: Why vomitings have occured? Are there any
signs of Raised ICT? If not so what can be the reason?
[29/05/20, 10:54:06 PM] Student20: May b
[29/05/20, 10:54:07 PM] Student20: Due to
[29/05/20, 10:54:11 PM] Student20: Turberculoma
[29/05/20, 10:54:39 PM] Student20: Lesions... AST is elevated which might cause
vomitings
[29/05/20, 11:05:59 PM] Student6: Yes.. heart failure can cause liver failure
which causes raised bilirubin... But is the patient having the heart failure of
the severity that is required to cause liver failure to cause increased
bilirubin levels...?
[29/05/20, 11:07:43 PM] Student17: Cause - https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/
articles/325838#causes
[29/05/20, 11:07:54 PM] Student17: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/
325838#causes
[29/05/20, 11:12:44 PM] Student17: No ! There is no raised ict . So no
projectile vomitings
[29/05/20, 11:55:49 PM] Student21: Is there a relation between gluteal abscess
and tb in this patient ?
[30/05/20, 9:53:48 AM] Post Residency PG1: What are projectile vomitings and
how are they different from regular vomitings?
[30/05/20, 9:59:38 AM] Post Residency PG1: How is AST related to increased
vomitings? Any scientific reference links with your quotes from the relevant
portions
[30/05/20, 10:06:17 AM] Student22: Projectile vomiting is a sudden occurence of
vomiting
Not preceeded by nausea
And expulsion of gastric contents with great force
[30/05/20, 10:08:01 AM] Post Residency PG1: So non nauseous is the key word?
Please share the source link for the definition. Also which physiological organ
is responsible for nausea that is spared here?
[30/05/20, 10:16:06 AM] Student22: https://www.healthline.com/health/
projectile-vomiting
[30/05/20, 10:17:20 AM] Post Residency PG1: Nope. Always share the relevant
portions in quotes. And share scientific articles with cross references
[30/05/20, 10:27:40 AM] Student22: No sir
Since it is a forceful explusion of gastric contents.. it may or may not be
preceeded by nausea..

Mostly we come cross projectile vomiting as a complaint in children..(most
common cause:infantile pyloric stenosis)
