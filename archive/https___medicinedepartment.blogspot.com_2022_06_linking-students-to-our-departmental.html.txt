**** Linking students, faculty and global citizen scientists to our
departmental current ongoing research projects to help them decide their own
topic work areas ****
Abstract (summary of the current ongoing projects in medicine department) :
Every individual clinical problem solving exercise is a unique valuable
contribution to global literature as each and every individual illness
trajectory that has been completed is a potential predictive match for an
individual illness trajectory that has just begun but days, months or years
away from completion. Our case based blended learning ecosystem (CBBLE) aims to
gather all these concrete individual experiences and use reflective,
qualitative, thematic analysis tools on the data  to generate conceptual
abstractions toward further active experimentation. It proposes to do so under
separate global project teams based on themes centred around problem solving
clinical complexity at organizational as well as organ system levels. The list
 of our current projects linked in detail below is also an invitation to all
our department team members (as well as global citizens and system users with
an interest in contributing to health research) to join our CBBLE that exists
primarily online and yet remains blended to our regular day to day hospital
based offline physical workflow. We share below many online links to our past
and current work thematically divided into organizational and organ systems
complexity along with links to joining  user driven healthcare UDHC  discussion
forums for our PGs and department members  along with global citizen
researchers to join and start contributing their questions and solutions online
along with their regular physical contributions offline in our regular work
location.  Users are free to start newer project groups and add our key members
to guide them online (and offline blended) once they get used to our collective
quest for improving health outcomes locally and globally. 

Key words : Medical cognition, clinical complexity, case based blended learning
ecosystem, user driven healthcare, case based reasoning, conversational
learning, qualitative ,non probability, snowball sampling

****** Multiple organ systems projects : ******
Communicable (Infectious) diseases:

Tuberculosis diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty :

Problem statement :

Private and government centers in India indulge in a lot of empirical
antitubercular therapy due to clinical complexity (diagnostic and therapeutic
uncertainty) surrounding it's management and how we may be able to reduce this
overdiagnosis and overtreatment of tuberculosis at the same time taking care
not to undertreat using hitherto unknown tools and it also builds on the theme
of how we in the past tackled clinical complexity surrounding poorly
differentiated fever using simple tools such as fever chart patterns and
checklists (another updated publication on our fever project is also long
overdue given the four year case report data on fever we have).

3) Medical education project done by our senior resident post MD and the "work
in progress" is linked below :

https://adityasamitinjay.blogspot.com/2022/04/qi-cycle-2-improving-inpatient-
medical.html?m=1

Once our PG students do their thesis well during MD, they may realize that it
could become a life long passion where they would continue to do various thesis
in various directions as a part of life long self directed learning. 

This one may be titled, 

"Clinical complexity drives learning outcomes in health professional online
learning portfolios, a quality improvement in medical education project."

There is a summary of our findings at the bottom of the link.

A QI cycle 3 will be run at the end of the 2016 interns batch academic year.
Online learning portfolios from June 2021 to May 2022 will be included.

And our CBBLE dashboard here : https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2022/02/
?m=0, contains thousands of "online learning portfolios" of our medical
students from five and more batches  with their logged and regularly evaluated
patient narratives (thousands of case reports links that keeps growing
everyday) toward their formative assessment that goes to formulate their
internal assessments marks.
