log book to discuss our patient's de-identified health data shared after taking
his/her/guardian's signed informed consent. Here, we discuss our individual
patient's problems through series of inputs from available global online
community of experts with an aim to solve those patient's clinical problems
with collective current best evidence based inputs

**** HEART FAILURE ****
I have been given this case to solve in an attempt to understand the topic of
"Patient Clinical Data Analysis" to develop my competency in reading and
comprehending clinical data including history, clinical findings,
investigations and diagnosis with a treatment plan.

You can find the entire real patient clinical problem in the following link:
https://madhur116.blogspot.com/2020/05/on-1452020.html?m=1

Following is my analysis of the patient's problem. The problems in the order of
priority I found are:
    * Shortness of breath since 2 weeks
    * Fatigue since 2 weeks
    * Pedal edema since 2 weeks
****** SHORTNESS OF BREATH (DYSPNEA) ******
Patient presented with shortness of breath which is acute in onset, NYHA class
3 initially and class 2 after treatment.
Some of the structures (differential) related to dyspnea are:
    * Cardiac
    * Respiratory
    * Anemia
    * Renal
    * Metabolic
    * Neuromuscular
    * Drugs
Based_on_history_and_examination
    * No history of cough ,cold and wheeze. This excludes respiratory cause of
      dyspnea
    * No history of facial puffiness and oliguria.So there is no renal
      involvement.
    * No history of chronic use of drugs such as NSAIDs, steroids.
    * No history of muscle pain,muscle loss, tingling and numbness.This
      excludes neuromuscular involvement.
    * Not a known case of diabetes mellitus
    * History of fatigue and PND are present.
From the above details I think there might beanemia_or_cardiac_pathology
****** PEDAL EDEMA ******
Patient presented with progressive bilateral pitting type of pedal edema
extending up to the knees.
Differential diagnosis for pitting type of pedal edema are:
    * Heart failure 
    * Kidney failure 
    * Liver failure
Based_on_history_and_examination
    * No history of periorbital edema and oliguria, so there is no renal
      involvement.
    * Ascites is present but not prominent as pedal edema.so there might not be
      hepatic pathology.
From the above details I think there iscardiac_pathology.

****** CARDIAC_PATHOLOGY ******
After analyzing the above complaints I am of the opinion that there is some
cardiac pathology.What could be the pathology???

In this case patient has fatigue, dyspnea, pedal edema which are cardinal
features of HEART FAILURE. Next question that arises is, Is it Right heart
failure or Left heart failure?? 
    * Symptoms of left heart failure are fatigue and dyspnea.
    * Symptoms of right heart failure are pedal edema, ascites.
Patient has features of both,so it must beCONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE.Possible
explanation is, left ventricular failure has lead to increase in pressures in
left atrium which lead to increase in pressures in pulmonary veins and arteries
leading to right heart failure.

Next question that arises is whether it is systolic failure or diastolic
failure?To know this 2D echo is performed.
Findings of 2D ECHO is:
    * Ejection fraction -27% - which suggests it is systolic failure(heart
      failure due to reduced ejection fraction).
**** HEART FAILURE DUE REDUCED EJECTION FRACTION ****
As we now know it is HFrEF , we should find the cause for this.Some of the
important causes are:
    * Myocardial infraction
    * valvular heart disease
    * non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy
Based_on_the_history_and_examination
    * There is no history of chest pain
    * There is no history of syncope
    * There is no history of palpitations
From this history we can eliminate MI (as there is no chest pain ),MS and AS
( as there is no chest pain,syncope,palpitation which are cardinal features).My
differential diagnosis is left with NON-ISCHEMIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY and 
MITRAL REGURGITATION.
To know the exact cause, investigations that are performed is:
**** 2D ECHO ****
    * EF -27%
    * global hypokinesia
    * all chambers are dilated
    * severe LV dysfunction
    * severe MR
    * trivial AR
    * mild TR
    * no MS/AS
    * no pulmonary emboli and LV clots
    * mild pulmonary artery hypertension
    * IVC dilates not collapsing
As all the chambers are dilated MR and TR are also present.Based on the above
findings,my diagnosis is NON-ISCHEMIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY.
What might be the etiology related to it???It could be inflammatory
cardiomyopathy or alcohol induced dilated cardiomyopathy.
Patient also has a history of fever with chills 1 month back. So I think there
might be some infective cause of myocarditis. To know the exactly which
organism is involved, following investigations can be done.
    * ECG 
    * 2D ECHO
    * Serum levels of troponin
    * Creatinine phosphokinase fractions
    * MRI
    * Immunohistochemistry
    * PCR
Since most common cause of myocarditis is due to viral etiology , I am of the
opinion it might be viral myocarditis.

**** TREATMENT ****
Pharmacological treatment
    * Captopril
    * Candesarten
    * Valcyclovir
    * Gancyclovir
    * Interferon beta
    * treatment that is given :Tab.lasix 80mg...40mg...40mg
                                      Tab.isosorbide mononitrate10mg bd
                                             Tab.hydralazine 25mg
                                             Tab. Telma20mg
Non pharmacological treatment 
    * reduce physical activity
    * reduce salt intake
    * fluid restriction

      [29/05/20, 8:38:19 AM] MBBS 2016 student : Sir I have doubt. It may not
      be related to this case but by seeing his foot I felt that there is
      increase is space between great toe and 2nd toe.
      Just wondering is there any reason or it is normal

      ￼

      [29/05/20, 9:14:24 AM] Post residency pg 1: Excellent observation. 👍👏👏

      We missed this. This could mean the gene that did that to his foot may
      also have been responsible for the faulty muscle expression in his
      myocardium that may have coincided with a febrile illness to manifest as
      heart failure?

      [29/05/20, 9:15:09 AM] MBBS 2016 student: But was that all of sudden or
      is it from birth

      [29/05/20, 9:15:54 AM] MBBS 2016 student: If it is from birth then why
      did he didn’t have symptoms before

      [29/05/20, 9:18:28 AM] Post residency pg 1: Good question again. Possibly
      the febrile illness precipitated it?

      [29/05/20, 9:34:43 AM]MBBS 2016 student:Maybe sir

      [29/05/20, 12:45:44 PM] MBBS 2016 student : And how was it diagnosed as
      viral origin myocarditis

      [29/05/20, 12:46:37 PM] Intern 2015 1: Because few days before he was
      suffering from viral fever

      [29/05/20, 12:46:52 PM] MBBS 2016 student : Malaria??

      [29/05/20, 12:47:13 PM] Intern 2015 1: Later there could be viral
      myocarditis...

      [29/05/20, 12:47:19 PM] MBBS 2016 student: It is mentioned as treatment
      with antimalarials

      [29/05/20, 12:47:23 PM] Intern 2015 1: That's why we thought of it

      [29/05/20, 12:47:42 PM] Intern 2015 1: Some rmp gave it seems
