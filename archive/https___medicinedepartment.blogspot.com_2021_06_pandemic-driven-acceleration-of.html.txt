**** Pandemic driven acceleration of scholarly integration between ways of
knowing and doing in healthcare ****
Quoting verbatim from a recent essay in Lancet global health particularly
focused on India although very relevant globally,

"Academic institutions and professional medical societies should reflect on
their roles. A range of recommendations and treatment algorithms from norm-
defining medical institutions and societies are circulating on social media.
These institutions are notable by their failure to share the evidence that
informs these recommendations, discuss nuances of implementation, or present
conflicts of interests of those involved in developing these recommendations.
These recommendations give fillip to low-value care and provide medical
practitioners with a justification to use them."

The current chaos in modern medical healthcare reflects a failure of evidence
based medical education and research directed at the end beneficiary of Medical
education, that is the patient and the time is ripe for scholarly integration
to develop the optimal adaptive systems framework for it. More about it in the
description but before that a quick look at the history of "integration of
medical education and research" from 200 years in India with the British
integrating their system of Western Medicine with that of the pre existing
Indian system with near total demise of the Indian system.
