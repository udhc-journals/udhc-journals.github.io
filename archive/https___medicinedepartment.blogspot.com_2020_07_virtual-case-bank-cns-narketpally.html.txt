          A few common questions for the students

          1) Where are the different anatomical locations for the
          cause of the problem  for each of these patients?

          2) What is the most likely pathology and etiology in that
          anatomical location?

          3) What are the diagnostic and therapeutic options in such
          situations and what is the efficacy of each option/
          intervention?

          4) Please share questions that come to your mind upon going
          through each of the cases.
