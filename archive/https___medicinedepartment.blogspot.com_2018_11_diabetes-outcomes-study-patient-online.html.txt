One of the outcomes is to " determine the fraction of patients found to be able
to engage in moderate intensity postprandial exercise, as counselled, during
the week and detected by way of HbA1c measured at the beginning and end of the
12 week protocol"


The other outcome is to test the role of a chemical known for its GLP1
facilitation
