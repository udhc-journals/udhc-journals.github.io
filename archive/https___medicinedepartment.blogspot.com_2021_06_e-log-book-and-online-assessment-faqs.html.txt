**** E log book and online assessment FAQs and Q&A conversational learning ****
Q1) from student 1: Sir about the E logs, can we contact an intern to know
about the cases? Or can we write from the cases you have posted in the E log
Medicine group?

Medicine Department Faculty coordinator FC : Yes please contact the interns and
please take the history yourself on phone from the patient or relatives to get
the maximum out of this learning experience

Q2) And sir, can I ask them their personal details like Name, age and such?

FC: Yes off course but be careful to never reveal those in the E logs. 

Also please take a signed informed consent from them in the language of their
choice that can be downloaded here http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/
05/informed-patient-consent-and.html?m=1


Student Response : Sure sir, I'll be sure to respect the patients' privacy
always. Thank you very much sir, I'll be sure to send it and get it signed by
the patients before taking their history


Q3) Deidentification :

The identifiers need to be completely removed including the name of Institute
and dates. The dates have to be mentioned as year and season (such as summer of
2021 etc) and post admission dates should be Day 1, Day 2 etc

Details quoted below from the link here :
https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-
identification/index.html

Please refrain from using any identifiers in your case reports. Keep the signed
informed consent from the patient safely with you. 

The following identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or
household members of the individual, are removed:

(A) Names

(B) All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address,
city, county, precinct, ZIP code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the
initial three digits of the ZIP code if, according to the current publicly
available data from the Bureau of the Census:
(1) The geographic unit formed by combining all ZIP codes with the same three
initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and
(2) The initial three digits of a ZIP code for all such geographic units
containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000

(C) All elements of dates (except year) for dates that are directly related to
an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, death
date, and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year)
indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated
into a single category of age 90 or older

(D) Telephone numbers

(L) Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers

(E) Fax numbers

(M) Device identifiers and serial numbers

(F) Email addresses

(N) Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)

(G) Social security numbers

(O) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses

(H) Medical record numbers

(P) Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints

(I) Health plan beneficiary numbers

(Q) Full-face photographs and any comparable images

(J) Account numbers

(R) Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code, except as
permitted by paragraph (c) of this section [Paragraph (c) is presented below in
the section “Re-identification”]; and

(K) Certificate/license numbers

Online assessment FAQs:

Please answer this monthly online summative assessment by 31st June :

https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/06/medicine-department-paper-for-
june-2021.html?m=1

Q1: from student 2: Is this for 2019 batch students too?

Answer: This question paper is a formative evaluation through a monthly
summative test opportunity for all students associated with the medicine
department beginning with 2019, 2017, 2016 interns and all PGs. This test
utilizes E logs created by all the afore mentioned students, shares the last
monthly test results for peer to peer review/assessments and is essentially a
formative tool to promote assessment FOR learning rather than assessment OF
learning

Q2) Sir I'm very sorry but I cannot understand where is the question paper?

The first links are for our understanding on how to write the assessment? But
what are the questions we need to answer are they the same and we are required
to give our own answer?

Answer : They are marked Q1 to Q5 and are merged in the clarifying narrative
that accompanies the question

Scroll down to more than half of the page to find them

Student 2: 

Ah yes found them Sir 😁 
Thank you. So I should post the answer in my blog citing the question link and
any external reference

Student 1:

Sir, a few students have expressed a doubt regarding the third question  from
our July 2021  assignment 
linked here: http://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2021/07/medicine-paper-for-
july-2021-bimonthly.html?m=1
around Q3) and I quote, 

"(Testing peer review competency of the examinees) :

Please go through the cases in the links shared above and provide your critical
appraisal of the captured data in terms of completeness, correctness and
ability to provide useful leads to analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic
uncertainties around the cases shared"

 Sir, should the critical appraisal be done for any one elog, like last time,
or all 11 - 12 elogs ?

FC answer: Q1 and Q3 offer testing of two different types of competency.

While Q1 focuses on your competency to assess other's ability to write an
answer on different topics covered from Q1 to Q5 in the previous month's
assignment, the Q3 assesses the ability of the people who made the case reports
and the clarity and validity of the case report content in those E log links.
It's important to attempt all of them to learn more and attempting just one
will restrict our learning to one
