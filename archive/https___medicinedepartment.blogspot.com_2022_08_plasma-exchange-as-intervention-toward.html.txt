**** Plasma exchange as an intervention toward longevity: a journal club in our
global CBBLE ****
Conversational learning transcripts below that reflects the online journal club
interactions and selective sampling and critical appraisal of the journal
published study content and the camaraderie:



[8/27, 1:19 AM] Sumit Global CBBLE:

Context: David is one of the pioneers of longevity research.


[8/27, 5:53 AM] Rakesh Biswas: Any links to the real paper for a proper
appraisal in the PICO format?


[8/27, 10:15 PM] Sumit Global CBBLE: It's in the tweet (the link at the end)


[8/27, 10:19 PM] Rakesh Biswas: Can someone appraise it in the PICO format?
@⁨Aashita KIMS PG⁩


[8/27, 10:26 PM] Aashita KIMS SR : 

Sure sir
I’ll go through it


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS SR: 

Quoting, 

To investigate the effect of TPE, we examined blood samples before and after
rounds of this clinical procedure
P - 15 samples were included 
I - Samples 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 were from old individuals 
C - Samples 3 and 5 were from middle-aged people
( I’m assuming the remaining samples belong to the younger age group but they
haven’t  clearly mentioned their sample numbers)


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS SR: 

Quoting, 

Changes in 8-OHdG levels after TPE.Oxidative DNA damage gradually decreases and
becomes statistically lower by the last round, in all patients.
[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS PG: R0 is before TPE, R1 is 1 month afterwards
and before the next round of TPE, and so on.


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS PG: 

Quoting, 


C. TPE decreases p16 levels in PBMCs of old and middle-aged people, 
D. TPE upregulates the markers of lymphoid genes (T cells, B cells, NK cells)
in old PBMCs. E The lymphoid:myeloid ratio is increased by the rounds of TPE.
The myeloid:NK ratio is downregulated by TPE. The ratios of lymphoid:CD68 and
NK:CD68 are elevated by the rounds of TPE. 

These data show a rejuvenation of the lymphoid/myeloid balance, suggesting an
improved capacity for productive immune responses


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS SR: 

Quoting 

Out of 507 proteins, 72 proteins were significantly different in their levels
between the old and the young groups (> 1.75 fold change, p < 0.05). These 72
proteins were analyzed further in the longitudinal TPE datasets by heat
mapping, which revealed a gradual rejuvenation of the age-specific systemic
proteome by subsequent rounds of TPE. Principal component analysis confirmed
that each R0 proteome (before the first TPE) was closer to the old control
group than to the young control group and shifted from the old toward the young
group with the rounds of TPE


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS SR : 

Quoting, 

We also determined whether repetitive TPE may regulate the complement system
including C3 and C1q, which play a key role in immune responses and also
participate in non-immune crosstalks of cell–cell signaling pathways


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS PG: In our analysis, 13 proteins were related to
the negative regulation of apoptosis and the levels of these proteins were
higher in the old group than in the young. Consistent with better tissue
homeostasis, the levels of these apoptotic inhibitors diminished over rounds of
TPE, becoming closer to the young cohort


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS SR: 

Quoting, 

Considering these observations, we decided to analyze systemic levels of TDP43,
which is the trigger of several neurological pathologies and becomes increased
in the blood of patients with ALS, Parkinson’s disease (PD), frontotemporal
dementia (FTD), and AD


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS SR: 


Circulating TDP43 levels are higher in old than in young individuals


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS SR: 

Summary: (Quoting) 


Among 15 samples post TPE the oxidative dna damage reduces by each round of
TPE.  TPE also increased the lymphoma myeloid balance basically improving the
immune responses. It also regulates complement C3 and C1q.  Circulating TDP43
were found to be higher in older ages but with TPE, TDP43 reduced gradually.


[8/27, 11:56 PM] Aashita KIMS SR: 

Quoting, 

The effect of repetitive TPE on aged blood. Aged blood has the characteristics
of chronic inflammation (inflammaging), increased PBMC DNA damage and
senescence, and immune deregulation, all changes that promote the high risk of
diseases. TPE resets the systemic milieu to a younger state by rapidly and
significantly diluting the age-elevated inhibitors of the canonical signaling
pathways that regulate tissue maintenance and repair.


[8/28, 8:10 AM] Rakesh Biswas: Thanks. Also please share the direct link to the
paper


[8/28, 8:19 AM] Rakesh Biswas: Thanks 

So to critically appraise this @⁨Sumit Global CBBLE⁩ , David Sinclair has
currently just begun to show scientists looking at certain chemical changes
demonstrable on Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) as reflected in his obtained
outcomes that simply mention the chemical changes as a result of TPE but don't
tell us what actually happened in terms of longevity in the participants who
received TPE. 

That may require a follow up of the same or more cohorts and one would also
need to figure out the optimal frequency of TPE necessary to maintain the
levels of the currently assumed healthy chemical balance. 

In essence this was a phase 2 study that shows promise but there's a long way
ahead


[8/28, 8:24 AM] Sumit Global CBBLE: Interesting, thanks.

Regarding you question, as I've previously stated: DNA damage is directly
linked to DNA methylation clock which is a standard ageing biomarker by now
(until something cheaper and more reliable comes along).

So I guess we can say that TPE promises longevity (if this study replicates
well in more trials)?

I agree regarding your points on the optimal frequency exploration.


[8/28, 8:26 AM] Sumit Global CBBLE: 

And thanks for the detailed PICO analysis @⁨Aashita KIMS PG⁩


[8/28, 8:27 AM] Sumit Global CBBLE: Thanks for simplifying the appraisal! 🙏


[8/28, 8:30 AM] Rakesh Biswas: Yes it's promising but too early to draw
conclusions. 

Standard biomarkers are never standalone and have only been provided assumed
causal associations in relation to more palpable clinical determinants such as
morbidity, mortality, longevity and we would need to look again critically at
those papers that have drawn causal association between oxidative DNA and
patient outcomes


[8/28, 8:32 AM] Rakesh Biswas: Thanks for sharing the paper and this journal
club, which I shall be archiving.

Please tell our audience here a little bit about yourself. 🙂


[8/28, 8:37 AM] Sumit Global CBBLE: True, promising but not 100% confirmation.

Here's the catch-22 with aging - good trials would need to run for 200 years
(or atleast 150 if parallelized) to be perfectly sure of the outcomes given
that the trials would need to run atleast twice the lifespan (repeating
promising studies, or starting more studies in parallel that promise
improvement in biomarkers to run them in their full length).

So I guess, in our lifetimes we would need to rely on best biomarkers available
that improve the well being of the species in a noticeable way.

Are there other ways to be sure?

I tried doing this thing where I learnt a new field from the experts - was fun.
It's limited to the design field though.



[8/28, 9:09 AM] Sumit Global CBBLE: Sure sir. I'll tell the group about myself.

Hi all, I'm Sumit Srivastava, primarily a technologist with extremely diverse
interests.

Every couple of years I pick a field that I know nothing about and immerse
myself into it, learning from the best.

Then overtime, I gradually accumulate knowledge in that field while also
picking up new fields subsequently.

This method has worked decently over the years for learning various different
things.

I've started noticing that a most problems have simple and logical solutions,
even though they may seem complex at the first glance. 

I picked up the field of medicine as a challenge a few years ago after working
on some interesting things in brain computer interfaces.

Now I love the field of medicine so much that I've started exploring
interesting (and promising) sub fields of the vast knowledge available in
medicine.

As a child I knew that the my innate nature was that of curiosity - asking a
lot of questions.

I've tried to not let that die (it's super hard, because questioning everything
comes at the cost of speed of doing things).

Over time, you learn to question the things that matter the most.

I've learnt that the best things to question are the things that people think
are either "really obvious" or things that are "mostly unexplored".

I take my inspiration from an excellent paper called you and your research by
Dr. Richard W. Hamming, a pioneer in computer science.

Even though I'm not a researcher - this is one of the most groundbreaking paper
an ambitious individual can read in their lifetime (it's super long): https://
