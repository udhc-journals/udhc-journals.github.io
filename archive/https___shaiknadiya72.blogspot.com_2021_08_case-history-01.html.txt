PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS:
This is a case of acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis
secondary to snake bite with thrombocytopenia.
TREATMENT:
1. Foley's catherization for output monitoring
2. Oral fluids 3lites/ day
3.injection lasix 40mg / BD
4. Strict I/0 monitoring
5. Inj PAN iv/ OD
6. Inj zoffer 4mg/ iv
7. Inj Buscopan IM/ BD
TYPES OF SNAKES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS WITH CLINICAL FEATURES:
1. COBRA, SEA SNAKES, MAMBAS: neurotoxic-
C/f: hypotension, shock, other organ dysfunction( renal impairement)
2 VIPERS- Haemotoxic
C/f: progressive swelling., hypovolemic shock, development of blisters and
bruises.
3. NAJA - extensive tissue injury and nervous injury
CAUSE OF  SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS:
venom alters capillary membrane permeability  causing extravasationof
electrolytes, red blood cells and albumin through the vessel wall into the
envenomated site. This process occurs in the lungs, kidney, myocardium,
pericardium rarely CNS.
MECHANISM OF VIPER TO CAUSE TUBULAR BLOCKADE:
The damage to tubular cells of kidneys caused by lack of blood flow and oxygen
which results in ischemia. 
It may occur if the kidney cells are damaged by a poison or harmful substances.
This condition results in Acute tubular necrosis which can lead to Acute kidney
injury.
TECHNIQUES FOR REMOVAL OF VENOM FROM THE BODY:
1. first aid
2. Administration of antisnake venom
