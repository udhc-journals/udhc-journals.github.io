     their E logs below for the online 8th semester students to go through
     this week and answer some of the case related questions and also come
     out with their own queries:

     information into this E log above

     session-on-global.html?m=1

Post active learning global online session with our global CBBLE the same PG
presented this patient offline locally here

     A few common questions for the 8th semester students

     1) Where are the different anatomical locations for the cause of the
     shortness of breath and palpitations for each of these patients?

     2) What is the most likely pathology and etiology in that anatomical
     location?

     3) What are the diagnostic and therapeutic options in such situations
     and what is the efficacy of each option/intervention?

     4) Please share questions that come to your mind upon going through
     each of the cases.

     Each 8th semester student will share their answers in their own E
     logs. Thanks to all the 8th semester students for sharing all their
     200 web based logs that will remain as their 'online learning
     portfolios,' and will be very useful toward their formative
     assessment in the coming months and years. More here:

     education-and.html?m=1

Sample active learning discussion of the same 2016 UGs last week around three
patients of paraparesis here:

     https://medicinedepartment.blogspot.com/2020/05/paraparesis-case-
     based-questions-and.html?m=1

     Once the 8th semesters join hospital duties they will be expected to
     evaluate their own patients in the wards and create their own patient
     online records.
